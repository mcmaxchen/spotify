    "description": "Each track on this album has been written with the help of Indian ragas: scalar and melodic patterns that convey distinct essences of emotions. To this, I have added sounds of rock, jazz and whatever else that came in my mind. The combination works.\n\nA host of influences have converged here ranging from the ancient sounds of Indian ragas to contemporary hip-hop beats. The result is sometimes hypnotic and sometimes melancholic. Our ancestors had a much deeper connection with music than we do, on a spiritual and emotional level. I would like to reestablish that connection.\n\nCrescent Moon features the mohan veena, a modern version of an ancient Indian instrument. The mohan veena, being a slide instrument, possesses the ability to play microtonally and bring out the true nature of the ragas.\n\n",

    "description": "In late 2007, during the creation of The Dawn EP I became more and more interested with merging familiar styles of synthpop, downtempo and ambient music with a more progressive, semi-breaks driven sound. I had been writing music in a similar sort of vein since late 2006, and after experimenting with a more chilled sound decided that this was absolutely the direction I wanted to pursue for my first full length release. I was becoming more and more fascinated by melody-driven dance music at the time and decided to fuse this with my already existing synthpop/atmospheric-driven sound.\n\nThe album really started to take form with the production of the title track in January 2008. The bulk of the production occurred during my placement year at university, working primarily within my humble bedroom studio at the time which essentially consisted of me, my laptop, Reason 4, an orchestral sound kit, a microphone and a guitar. As the album continued to take shape I found myself drawn towards themes of finding beauty in darkness as well as light, isolation and redemption. This led to the album taking on a heavily introspective, contemplative tone, forming a steady emotional undercurrent to the album itself.\n\nThe songs themselves were taken from a mixture of existing tracks (re-worked to fit with the style and mood of the album) and new tracks written and produced during 2007-2008. I sent the album as-is to several labels during its creation and, after receiving little to no response, decided to stop wasting my time and release the album independently initially. I genuinely believed I had created a body of work that suitably summed up my influences and experiences prior to that point, and was desperate to share it with anyone who wanted to listen. A combination of Magnatune, CDBaby and a short-run CD copy provided me with the means to get my music out there to anyone who wanted to listen. I decided to focus my efforts on what I knew best - writing and producing music. At the time I didn't fully appreciate the amount of work and effort that would go into releasing a record independently, but I'm still incredibly glad I did.\n\nDistant Activity was officially released in September 2008, just before I commenced my final year at university. Things came full circle when it was picked up and re-released digitally through Distinctive Records in late 2010. A selection of out-takes from the Distant Activity production sessions was released on March 7th 2012 as the free EP Background Activity.\n",

    "description": "A musical survey of the wonderful repertoire of solo lute music from 16th century Italy, adapted for and played on the guitar. The recording ranges from the earliest printed music from Venice to the rich counterpoint of the time of Palestrina.\n\n\"In playing this music, I followed some simple guidelines. It is important to understand that the music is played directly from its original notation - lute tablature - without changes, deletions or other enhancements. I prefer to think of them as adaptations rather than transcriptions and this is a guitar recording, not an attempt to imitate the lute. The pieces are played at the normal baritone pitch of the guitar, without the use of a capo on the neck, rather than at the higher pitch of the tenor lute. (Lutes were often made in families of instruments with different string lengths and body sizes adapted to ensemble playing, so it is entirely within historic practice that the music be played at this pitch. Indeed, it gives the music a meditative and appealing sonority.)\n\nIn order to preserve the chord structure and voicings so characteristic of the instrument, I opted to re-tune the guitar to the normal relative tuning of the lute, altering the third string so that the intervals remain the same (G=F#). In accordance with the speaking articulation of the period, I minimized the slurring of notes (one pluck, several notes) which is common in the music of the guitar.\n\nOne of the fundamental differences between the lute of the 16th century and the modern concert guitar is the stringing of the two instruments. In order to overcome the short sustain of gut strings, earlier lutes' bass courses were accompanied by a thinner string tuned an octave higher, which produces a shimmer in the sound, [an emphasis on higher partials]. There are numerous instances in which the higher of the two notes becomes important in the voicing, harmony and continuity of the melodic line. It is not really feasible to duplicate this feature on a single- stringed guitar, and I have added this note(s) where it is particularly important to the structure of the piece.\"\nAlan Rinehart\n",

The actual composers as well as its origin are mostly unknown, so we can only hope that we will give justice and proper respect to those amazing musicians who came before us and made this distinctive sound.\n\nLets rewind for a moment?\n\nRakija, an alcoholic beverage with its origin in the Balkan region, can be found on every household table during celebrations, weddings, funerals, and even in times of sickness because many believe in its deep-rooted medicinal powers. It's no surprise then that this same drink brought Almer and Nirvan together, thousands of miles away from their homeland, and in one drunken night gave them the inspiration to take off on this unique musical journey that we hope you all will enjoy.\n\nDisclaimer to our listeners: this album is best enjoyed with your own glass or two of rakija and a mezza plate.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nSpecial Guests:\nJessica Pierce: flute\nLauren Baba: violin\nBob Dominguez: drums (tracks 1, 2, 7 and 9)\nSuki Medencevic: accordion and clarinet\n",

An album that gives a mixture of uptempo and ambient in a shorter format than the usual electronic music of today. Electro Retro strives to give the listener a feel for the new sound synthesisers gave to the listening public. A sound, which in its heyday was not thought of as real music, but as a new world of the new wave of synthetic sounds. A sound that today seems more historic than commercial.\n\nHeavy rhythms, sweeping synth combined with real bass sounds and synthetic leads all go into the \"Electro Retro\" mixing pot.\n\nThe artwork was left to the artist RIKO.

To achieve this goal effectively, they work on essential elements and ideals in the singing and in the presentation. Thus, conducing the listener to a meditative state and inner harmony by following the directions perfected by generations of Indian artists and mystics.\n\nKedarika is conceived for deep relaxation and may be used as support for yoga, meditation or massage. The music is based on raga Kedar (a night melody) and the knowledge of nada yoga as inherited by the dhrupad tradition of singing.\n\nRagini KEDARIKA has been described as follows in the ancient texts:\n...a rare book in her hand, she sits, beautifuly dressed in front of the temple of Shiva, Lord of Sleep. (Raga-sagara)\n...her mind is immersed in contemplation of the Lord of Sleep... (Sangita-darpana)\n\nAmelia Cuni: vocals, tanpura\nWerner Durand: drones, sound design\n\n(Werner does not play any wind instrument here, but has elaborated the tanpura sounds into a drone)\n",

    "description": "Berlin Calls is the third gentle jazz album from AndrewPlusJohn. Maybe a bit darker than the other ones, but still beautiful and laidback. Maybe also a tiny bit more bluesy than the other ones, but still ambient and smooth. AndrewPlusJohn is not much for huge differences and giant leaps when it comes to elaborating on their music. They have a formula and they twist it in a gentle way. If you like AndrewPlusJohn, you will love their third album that takes you to familiar territory, but with some developments regarding production values. This album is bigger and deeper sounding.\n",

The setting is built on gracious and soulful electric guitar, inspired by the gentle side of Carlos Santana, Larry Carlton, Jeff Beck and David Gilmour... and then a touch of Daniel Lanois.\n\nThe feeling is that of a small electric jazz and soul ensemble, with added textures of synthesizers, strings and percussion: a modern jazz fusion environment. The compositions have that \"singable\" quality of seemingly simple melodies, but always with a twist or a deep dimension, and always with a guitar that is played with heart and soul... not just fingers. From the song \"Gilmour Estrada\", which is a tribute to David Gilmour and the instrumental Pink Floyd, to the epic movie soundtrack feeling of the song \"Fish River Canyon\", and the joyful thielemans-jazz-waltz \"April ? May Revisited\"; the album \"Sonic Embrace\" will transport you on a flowing, calm and magical journey that you will not forget.\n\nAndrewPlusJohn is here with their second instrumental album, titled Sonic Embrace. With this new release, the duo has established their voice and they present it with great self-confidence.\n",

When you notice Your energy cycling then your mind wakes up, beginning the unique movement to an overall objective - to a higher awakening.\n\nThe music here urges to play an important role in this process. It will help you to be adjusted and will set a rhythm. Physiological processes start to occur in the resonance to your aspiration to reach a qualitatively new condition of consciousness. The melody charms your soul, involves emotions to the necessary tonality and intensity. So that they don't disturb the main process and human transformations in divinity are helped. The Tantra sexual practices are useful as well to an improvement in the quality of mutual relations. Music is ideally suited for pair practices (movements, breath, sensitivity and empathy improvement).\n\nEmotional and \"clockwork\" rhythms from India in combination with polyphonic electronic pads underline the special melodies from Angelight's music. The moderate quantity of \"electronics\" in the music keep it alive sounding and resonate the ideas of Tantra with Western shades. It allows the music not to stay too deeply within folklore, and wrongly labeled world music.

It is best to listen simply having relaxed and allowing yourself to travel to the world of light. It is also possible to use this music for yoga or meditation, or to reflect over the meaning of your life in a philosophical solitude.\n\nTo find paradise people go to the end of the Earth and directly to the depths of Space, however the heavenly spot is first of all where the person finds himself. It is necessary to look in the internal space. For this purpose it is necessary to stop all external vanity, to switch on the music and to begin a way to the spiritual space. And only there the Paradise Gate will open for you.\n\nThe Gate of Paradise\nZen Master Hakuin - one of a few, blossoming.\nSometime ago the great soldier, the Samurai, came and asked: \"Where is Hell? Where is Paradise? If there is Paradise and a Hell, Where are the gates and how can I enter?\"\nThis person was the simple soldier. Soldiers are always simple and artless. He knew only two things: life and death. He didn't have any philosophy, he simply wanted to know, where to avoid the gate of Hell and how to get to Paradise.\n...And Hakuin answered so that the soldier could understand. \"Who are you?\" - Hakuin asked. \" I am the Samurai\", answered the soldier. It is very honorable thing to be a Samurai in Japan. It means to be the perfect soldier, who doesn't deliberate for a second whether to leave his life or not. He was told: \"I am a Samurai, the leader of Samurais. The Emperor pays a tribute of respect to me\". Hakuin burst out laughing and answered: \"Are you the Samurai? You look like a poor ragamuffin!\" Samurai pride was touched. He has forgotten, what he had come for. He instantly snatched out a sword and was going to kill Hakuin. Hakuin laughed and told him: \"Here is the Hell Gate. With a sword, being angry, with Your ego - you will open them\". The Samurai immediately realized. He enclosed a sword in his sheath... And Hakuin told him: \"And here Paradise Gate opens\".\n\nImperceptible pressures in the body disappear, carrying away alarm and worry, and all the thoughts which fill your consciousness contribute to a high-quality rest. It is surprising that listening to spa-music Angelight has found it unnecessary to make any additional efforts to relax and have a rest - the body itself dumps superfluous pressure and weariness. The good relaxation allows us to be well rested, it helps to maintain an organism of force and to save up energy for self-restoration - here is the key to improvement and rejuvenation.\n",

On his early death in 1818 he was described by the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung as \"a pianist of rare talent and precision, a composer of study and spirit\". Like many other Viennese musicians of this time, Krufft studied law at the University of Vienna and then combined a career as a musician with a post in civil service.\n\nThe life of Jan Vaclav Stich has been described as \"resembling that of a novel\" (H.Kling). Born into a family of serfs, his early talent caught the attention of the local count who arranged for him to have specialist training. The high quality of wind musicians emerging from Bohemia at this time led Charles Burney to describe Bohemia as the \"Conservatory of Europe\". Stich later absconded and, going under the name of Giovanni Punto, became one of the biggest names in music, travelling the length and breadth of Europe. Beethoven's Sonata Op.17 for fortepiano and horn, thought to be the first composition for this combination, contains highly characteristic writing for both instruments.\n\nPunto's fame is reflected in a review of an early performance of the work in which a critic asked \"Who is this Beethoven? His name is not known to us. Of course, Punto is very well known\". Juxtaposed with the three sonatas on this disc is something of a curiosity. Arrangements and transcriptions of works were incredibly popular in Vienna during the early nineteenth century. Though the combination of horn and fortepiano might not be the most obvious choice for an arrangement of the Largo of Haydn's String Quartet Hob II;74 (the \"Rider\" quartet) the range of colours and the flexibility of both instruments chosen by the anonymous arranger suits the movement's elegant melody and subtle nuances.\n\nThe final composer on this disc, Leidesdorf, shared with Krufft and Beethoven the guidance of Johann Albrechstberger as a teacher. Haydn rated Albrechtsberger's skills highly describing him as \"the best teacher of composition among all present-day Viennese masters\". Sadly, today Leidesdorf is remembered mainly for his publishing house Leidesdorf und Sauer but was well known as a composer, pianist and guitarist during his lifetime. Schubert described him as a \"truly deep and good being\" but also \"hugely melancholic\". Unusually this \"Sonata pour pianoforte et cor concertans\", published in 1824, includes two names on the frontispiece; \"Bellonci und M.K.Leidesdorf\". Camilla Bellonci was an Italian horn player who settled in Vienna where he played for the KarntnertorTheatre and the Imperial Hofkapelle. The highly virtuosic writing for both instruments suggests a great deal of collaboration in the compositional process which may justify the \"equal billing\" of Bellonci and Leidesdorf on the frontispiece.\n",

    "description": "In World music, playing a traditional acoustic instrument doesn't necessarily mean that you have a traditional approach. If your oud (a traditional Arabic lute) is surrounded by electric bass, synthesizers, and samplers, chances are that you're providing modern Arabic pop and not traditional Arabic music. And when a bagpipe solo comes after an amplified electric guitar solo, you're probably hearing contemporary Scottish/Celtic rock instead of the sort of traditional Scottish/Celtic music that has been around for centuries.\n\nAnup's Embrace is an album of Indian sitar music, but it certainly isn't sitar music in the strict Indian classical sense; no one will mistake this 2003 release for a Ravi Shankar session. Rather, Anup puts a contemporary spin on instrumental sitar music, combining Indian classical elements with funk, rock, electronica, and club/dance music. Shankar and other Indian traditionalists are an influence, but so are non-Indian musicians and producers. You will never hear synthesizers on a true Indian classical album, but they're all over Embrace -- and you will never hear \"Jingle Bells\" in an Indian classical setting, but Anup does, in fact, offer an unlikely arrangement of that American Christmas standard (although original compositions dominate the CD). To be sure, \"Jingle Bells\" is a surprising choice for an Indian recording -- even a modern, Western-minded one like Embrace. But \"Jingle Bells\" lends itself surprisingly well to an instrumental sitar makeover.\n\nBy 2003 standards, Embrace isn't innovative or groundbreaking -- in the neo-Indian realm, there have been plenty of other people who used the sitar for funk, rock, electronica, and club/dance purposes. Nonetheless, Anup is good at what he does, and this enjoyable outing is worth acquiring if you appreciate a non-purist approach to the sitar.\nAlex Henderson\n",

However, Yoria's natural warmth makes this character charming in the way that cads can be when they're also talented, funny, and smart. It's a testament to Yoria's talent, in fact, that the general lack of typical indie rock neurosis comes off as refreshing rather that callous. Yoria is soulful, but mostly at peace with his preference for independence and fun. To wit, \"Call Me\" beautifully nuanced insight into the mind of the chronically unavailable male, and \"P.S.A.\" may be the most beguiling little ditty about masturbation ever written. \"Sevilla\" describes a seething jealousy in the most lilting possible tones, and \"At Least You've Been Told\" is a cagey rock number that rails against stagnant situations. \"Here To Stay\" is the highlight of the entire album though?it's a patiently delivered, doggedly inspiring pop shanty.

He stands as a country-rock prophet against the Sadducees of automated machinery and computer technology. It runs along the same conceptual lines as Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and My Morning Jacket's Z, however Cruel Waters uses organic sounds to present this modern dichotomy.\n\nThe exemplary \"Lonely World\" and \"Paradise Fades\" both acknowledge the competition between the sacred and the contemporary, but both are composed with a constant ear to alt-country influences and a toe in the alternative tub. In \"Too Late,\" Ganley attempts to warn us of our inevitable doom. \"Too late for science, too late for faith.. too late to save our souls, this is how it ends,\" he sings with breath-filled urgency. It is that kind of writing that draws the listener into the depth that this album offers. It reveals a great deal of focus on Ganley's part to construct such predominate concepts for Cruel Waters, while allowing it to come through with subtlety and care.\n\nStill, in the face of Ganley's alt-country Armageddon, he perseveres because, like every great artist knows, this is an existence of poles - the good with the bad. Ganley does his best to show why he worries for our humanity with songs like \"Only in our Dreams\", and \"Moonshine\" that pursue the bright side to our end with country panache and swagger. Ganley's material adopts muses that show the dark, modern side of life and the other that Ganley wants so badly to save.\n- Chris Galis, THE SCENE MAGAZINE, Ft. Collins, CO\n",

Somehow dark yet positive, Magic Season is an album of depth and nuance seldom heard on any level. Enjoy the magic!\n",

    "description": "The music draws from a wide range of influences, ranging from driving alternative country to lush acoustic pop to dark Western-tinged Americana. The songs are transporting and lush without losing the raw, sparse quality that gives them their unique weight and intimacy. Haunting harmonies and richly-textured, darkly blooming guitar tones provide an edgy backdrop for Ash's unforgettable songwriting and smoky, frayed-velvet lead vocals.\n\n\"Universe Acceptable\" is an album of questions asked and mysteries unexplained. Some questions are answered while others can never be. Finding peace in the face of the unknowable while trusting in one's self is a recurring theme on this diverse, passionate and powerful record. The songs speak to the spirit in all of us, drawing out compassion and acceptance laced with the idea that in humility lies true power and grace.\n\nJoin Ash on a musical journey and ask yourself: Is the universe acceptable in your mind, or do you need to see an explanation for the mystery?\n",

    "description": "The chansons on Asteria's third album are all gathered from one extraordinary manuscript, the celebrated Oxford 213 manuscript currently housed at the Bodleian Library in England. Aside from being the largest collection of 15th century chansons by known composers like Dufay and Binchois, it contains a great number of anonymous works from the earliest period of the the 15th century. Asteria chose to focus on this exquisite body of little-known works for Un tres doulx regard, and many of these songs have never before been recorded before.\n\nJust like the shy lover who is knocked off his feet by the merest glance from the object of his affections, the music of the first generation of Burgundian composers at the end of the ars nova is infused with the sweetness and explosive passion of new love. \"Un tres doulx regard\" - A most sweet glance - is the result of extensive archival research into this little-known period, dating roughly from 1390 to 1420, just before the meteoric rise (and subsequent fall) of Burgundian power and influence that would briefly propel Franco/Flemish art and music to the very apex of European fashion.\n",

When close friends became parents, Barry James decided to gift the family with a bedtime soundtrack more suited to their new situation. With Strange Slumber: Music for Wonderful Dreams, James has created an ambient album edgy enough for those soothed by feedback yet friendly enough to shepherd a newborn into dreamland.\n\nThis is not the musical numbing agent you know from elevators and waiting rooms. From the catchy but vaguely unsettling Aliens Talk Backwards to the delicately percussive Good Fortune, James reinterprets the genre in a manner that is both time-altering and timeless. Strange Slumber: Music for Wonderful Dreams is raw material for the imagination.\n\nThis entire album was written as a present to Barry's godson Fletcher Roberts and his parents, who are avid music fans and love to fall asleep to various kinds of music.\n\n\"Lost Highway\" was written and recorded in one take in an apartment closet. It was written on an open tuning guitar borrowed from a friend. Barry is still not sure what the tuning was.\n\n\"Curious Ghosts\" and \"Let Sleeping Ghosts Lie\" were written by electronically manipulating a song titled 'The Ghost Again' written by Barry James in 1999 for his old band 'The Sunflower Conspiracy'.\n\nThe song \"Feed\" was almost omitted from the collection, but was left in at the last minute because of the levity it added to the album.\n\nThe song \"The Watchmaker\" was finished on an airplane on a laptop computer, somewhere between Chicago OHare airport and Tucson International.\n\nBarry is fond of leaving ambient noise in his songs, like the foot pedal click at the beginning of \"Aliens Talk Backwards\", or the distant radio that can be heard at the end of \"Mother and Child\".\n\nThe variety of percussion instruments on \"Six String Lullaby\" were a last-minute addition to the song, and included sanding blocks, novelty 'magic' wands, and a pillow lined with small bells.\n\nA prevalent instrument used on this album is the eBow, an electromagnetic device that causes a guitar string to constantly vibrate, mimicking the sound of a bowed stringed instrument.\n\nThe front cover artwork cartoon doodles were taken from scratchpads from when Barry worked as a graphic artist.\n\nThe front cover model is photographer and model Natalie Paquette, also known as FetishFairie in certain online circles\n",

    "description": "A whip-smart blend of instrumental electronic, jazz, dub, and funk influences, best-seller The Introduction has a great buzzy feeling to it. Ulf Ivarsson teams up with some of the most interesting players on the contemporary Swedish music scene: keyboardist Per Wiberg (Opeth, Spiritual Beggars), trumpet player Goran Kajfes ?Sting, Oddjob, Nacka Forum, Blacknuss Allstars), cellist Raymond King (Chris Bailey, Page, Plant), and guitarist George Nakas (Safri Duo, Embryo Sthlm). The fantastic \"Blue Lights\" opens the album; Kajfes shows us how a trumpet line that might have been mournful in another track can sound deeply urbane with some effervescent rhythms set behind it. \"Direction Dub\" is a great track too?mellow and atmospheric but with that undercurrent of buzz that runs throughout the album. \"Saturn Blues\" is another highlight. It gives us great bluesy swaths of Kajfes' horn playing swirled into Ivarsson's stirred up beats and vibraphone by Wiberg.\n",

In the album \"Architects of Time\" you can join Ben for a stroll through some of the surprising landscapes that lie between Rock and Folk, to find a quirky and interesting musical world where laughter follows goose bumps in rapid succession.\n\nListening to the album, you will find out why nowadays, Robin Hood just fancies some time by himself every now and then; you will be introduced to an alternative version of paradise where Adam and Eve eat the serpent rather than the apple; and you will learn how a jet pack can be usefully employed during the first few hours of the day if you are not a self-declared \"morning person\".\n\nThe album presents you with intimate folk arrangements on the one end of the spectrum, and rock songs of epic breadth on the other. And everything that lies between the two. Lipstik Indie magazine calls the album a \"musical masterpiece\" and with so much musical goodness to be found on the album, who are we to disagree?!\n\nThe album also features astounding viola performances by Bimbi Urquhart. To give you an idea as to quite how astounding these are: album reviews so far have been divided over the question as to whether her work on the album was simply \"world class\" or in the \"ultimate world class\".\n\nLet's give it a listen, shall we...\n",

    "description": "Ben Rusch and Simon Charlton: The Truth Of All Love\"\nwith music by Ben Rusch and lyrics by Simon Charlton\n\n\"Pop, Folk, Rock, Progressive Rock influences merge in this innovative collaboration between the music of Ben Rusch and the lyrics of Simon Charlton.\"\n\nBen: Simon and I were keen on the idea of creating an entire album together, so after developing a concept, I asked for lyrics that would work with what we had in mind.\n\nMusically, the aim was to afford Simon's incredible lyrics as much breathing space as possible. In some songs, that philosophy yielded intricate arrangements - e.g. in \"I Will Love You For A Long Time...\" or \"She Comes To Me In My Hour Of Weakness\") - to reflect the emotional depth of the poetry; other songs are unadorned and patient - e.g. \"How Long Must I Wait...\" or \"That Night When We Fell\" - letting the song be carried on the strong shoulders of the lyrics . The overall sound of the album is organic and natural, with a high dynamic range and, if I may say so, interesting ways of creating a modern Rock/Folk sound with a range of untypical instruments in the mix.\n\nSimon:\n'The Truth of All Love' is an album where Folk and Jazz find expression alongside Rock and Americana in an alchemy of sounds created by Ben, who thankfully refuses the workaday stomp of guitar, bass, and drums. The songs are coloured with piano, accordion, mandolin, saxophone, percussion, and viola. The range of instrumentation providing for multiple shades of sound that carry the vocal to the heart of the lyric - the core of the flame. Here are the raw elements of a world that is intensely personal whilst at the same time being wholly universal; love as hallelujah and love as horror.\n\nBen's music seems a paradoxical embracing of a complex simplicity that allows for ease of entry into the song whilst never settling into a wearying repetition of second-hand cliche and empty gesture. Given such a tenderly created framework I believe that the love song here rises from the mire of redundancy, challenging both musically and lyrically its tendency towards the teeth achingly saccharine, the vapid, and over-stressed.\n\nIn a world where the disingenuous seek to hold sway 'The Truth of All Love' concerns itself with emotional truths, truths located in the lyrics, truths given greater resonance and range by Ben's music and voice. In a world where so much of music is merely dead sound echoing through a house of cards 'The Truth of All Love' is a deliberately defiant creation of substance. The same defiance exhibited by the strangers gathering the bloodstained shards of their broken hearts. Despite love's trials, its torments and tears, they still believe and that perhaps, finally, is the truth of all love...\n\nBen and Simon:\nWe are deeply grateful to Cosmo Wallace who (was) volunteered to create a beautiful piece of art for the album cover. We hope the songs find their way into your ears, minds and hearts, there to live and breathe, and to sing hauntingly beautiful songs when the mood strikes them. Enjoy!\n",

We are eagerly awaiting what God has in store for us. All proceeds from the sale of this album go directly into our adoption fund. Thank you for your donation. May the one true God be given glory through the gift he has given me.\n\nSong notes:\n\n\"Longing\" This song has a sense of anticipation and of not being fully complete. We are longing to have our daughter home with us even though we don't know her name, what she looks like or how old she is.\n\n\"Oceans Apart\" Our daughter and her forever family are for now, oceans apart.\n\n\"Coming Home\" This is one of my favorite songs to just sit down and play. Although the chord structure doesn't change, I never it play it the same way twice.\n\n\"Isaiah's Song\" This is a song I wrote for our son Isaiah before he was born. He was born in early 2006 and this was written in late 2005. No official lyrics but if you listen closely you can maybe put the words \"Isaiah, I love you so, I always will, Isaiah\" to the melody.\n\n\"My Daughter's Waltz\" This is the most recent song I have written. I wanted to write something whimsical yet distinctly feminine with the 3/4 waltz feel. I can't wait to play this for our daughter when she comes home.\n\n\"My Beloved and My Friend\" This is a very special song. I wrote this for Missy while we were dating. I proposed to her as it was playing (I have recorded it before), and she walked down the aisle to it at our wedding. She is and always will be my beloved and my friend.\n\n\"Iowa\" I wrote this song in 2003 right around the time we moved to Colorado. We took a road trip soon after through Iowa (where Missy has extended family) to Minnesota for Missy's brother's wedding. I needed a title for this song and driving through Iowa with it's unique beauty seemed to fit this song perfectly.\n\n\"...Walks with God\" I wrote this song in the Spring of 2004 after we experienced the miscarriage of our first baby. Trusting that our little one was whole and perfect, dancing with Jesus in heaven gave us great comfort during that time of deep sorrow.\n\n\"Stargazing\" When I first met Missy (my wife) she was teaching 2nd grade at San Jose Christian School. She had a piano in her classroom and invited me to come and play for her kids. This is one of the songs I played with the kids. They would lay down pretending to stargaze while I played this song.\n\nLearn more about our adoption at our blog.\n",

The recently released EP Signal is worth a listen.\"\nChris Hassiotis, Flagpole Magazine\n\n\"SIGNAL is authentic.

With songs of despair and bliss set to a disco beat, Boulevard continues to catch the attention of audiences and journalists everywhere.\n\nVice and Daring showcases Boulevard in resplendent form. Yeah, that's a fancy word, and one full of shiny imagery and projection, but it is perhaps the best possible for this record. The sheen of the production values contained are as professional as any local record has ever been. Still, Athens' Boulevard succeeds where many bands fail by actually having great songs to display via such methods, rather than attempting to polish a turd.\n\nFor all practical purposes, Boulevard is a band of unabashed anglophiles. They're beholden artistically to the musical lineage of David Bowie and Roxy Music, yet nothing about the music sounds as if they're merely lifting licks and postures. \"So Electric\" carries itself by way of flange-driven guitars and an infectious chorus reminiscent of The Undertones. \"Marie\" sounds very much like what could be an old outtake from a Suede album if that band actually had some balls rather than just a make-up kit. \"Dreams of Home\" is slightly darker with its synthesized intro and spaghetti-western-on-lithium guitar interlude. It's a perfect track for a late-night drive.\n\nThe band reaches deep into the pop continuum on \"Disarray\" which features a great choppy guitar (a technique that hasn't been used in a good way since the heyday of the Elephant 6) and a chorus worthy of any number of 1970s teen idol bands (Bay City Rollers, Partridge Family, etc.).\n\nVice and Daring is an ambitious release from a band that has never been short on ambition. It's proof that these guys have known all along exactly what they were doing.\nGordon Lamb - Flagpole Magazine, Athens, Georgia\n\n\"Proving that innovation doesn't have to be boring or soulless, Boulevard is a fine example of a band succeeding on pure guts and audacity.\"\nPerformer Magazine\n\n\"Boulevard are content but pushing themselves and their boundaries on each track, nailing \"Dreams of Home\" and a sweeping \"Hand in Hand\" that bring to mind classic, majestic Suede numbers or current efforts from the Tears.\"\nAllmusic.com (AMG)\n\n\"Simply put, Boulevard doesn't sound like a band that just released its first EP in 2004, and Vice and Daring doesn't sound like a sophomore effort. Boulevard consistently reminds listeners that rock music should be fun, kinetic and larger than life.\"\nSoutheast Performer Magazine\n\n\"The band's standout tracks include \"Marie\" and \"Dreams of Home.\" The strength of these tracks is in their melodies, skilled playing and contagious effervescence.\"\nTechnique\n\nProduced and engineered by Nathan Rudolf in Athens, GA.

Most artists change over the years, but it's rare for an artist to take several albums to get really, really damned good. This new album from Brad, \"Aerial Views\" is one of those times, when I get really excited about running Magnatune, because this album just blew me away. His music genre, which is a kind of dark, moody acoustic rock, isn't one I would normally listen to that much. This album, however, just floored me with its beautiful melodies, hooks, his slightly-high-pitched-and-slightly-rough-but-gorgeous voice. Even if this genre isn't something you'd normally be interested in, give it a listen.\n",

    "description": "A Magnatune best-seller, I Don't Know What I'm Doing by Brad Sucks may be one of the most ironically titled albums of all time, because this deeply hooky, wry indie rock by Brad Turcotte shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that he both knows what he's doing and definitely doesn't suck. Themes of clinical depression, cultural dysphoria, and relationships gone horribly wrong become darkly funny and catchy in his hands. \"Making Me Nervous,\" and \"Look And Feel Years Yonger\" are lo-fi gems, while \"Fixing My Brain,\" \"I Think I Started A Trend\" and \"Work Out Fine\" are wistfully brilliant slower numbers; they have a dazed worldliness that works perfectly with Turcotte's languid voice. \"Bad Attraction\" and \"Dirtbag\" demonstrate the blues fluency that give the songs a nice, gritty bottom and ramshackle grace. But neither the humor nor the relaxed pose of Turcotte's work can disguise the fact that he is wrestling with some genuinely dark stuff here; his work is smarter and more emotionally resonant than that of the vast majority of his indie rock peers -- qualities that culminate in the tender existentialism of \"Overreacting.\" Fun and stunning by turns, I Don't Know What I'm Doing is one of those albums that yields more with each listen. Highly recommended.\n",

    "description": "Phoenix based indie pop/rock dup Broken Poets explore philosophy and universal energy on a self-titled four song EP that previews their ambitous upcoming multi-media project \"for the death of Dustin Essary\"\n\nSince the release of their eco-conscious 2008 album Everything In Nature, NYC bred, Phoenix based indie pop/rockers Broken Poets have stripped down to a duo for both live performances and recording. Founder and singer/songwriter and guitarist Tim McDonald plays his guitar with delays to cover the bass and drum parts, and classically trained Russian pianist, keyboardist and vocalist Lana Antropova has added \"kick drum\" to her repertoire.\n\nCarrying on the seamless vibe and philosophy rich themes that once earned them critical raves as \"soulful poetry turned into song, rock ? roll and introspection all in one,\" Broken Poets release a compelling four song self titled EP as a prelude to a wildly ambitious multi-media project that employs Lana's skills as a visual artist and Tim's as a writer of prose. Its unique title is also the name of the fourth song on the EP, \"For The Death of Dustin Essary.\" The other songs, \"Singularity,\" \"The Clairvoyant\" and \"My Selfish Altruism,\" develop themes and characters first introduced to Tim as a child by his friend Dustin Essary, who had dreams relating to each theme as he battled cancer from the ages of ten to thirteen. Tim began writing songs shortly after Dustin's passing and now, decades later, expresses his emotions and the lessons learned from this unique friendship in powerful musical ways. Tim and Lana's vision is enhanced by project co-producer and mixer Joe Myers, a long time artist friend of the two.\n\n\"These songs came out of the blue over the past few years,\" says Tim. \"Dustin had these dreams before he died and I created fiction around the images he once told me, writing songs as part of larger chapters. One song is about a scientist, another about a clairvoyant and the third about a spiritual leader. The overriding theme ties in the idea that often when creative people come up with incredible ideas, we think they're crazy - only to realize later that they're not. Philosophically, Broken Poets is working on the idea that science, metaphysics and religion are linked somehow by an underlying universal energy. In our story, those three fields tap into that energy and there is a lot of crossover.\"\n\nThe EP's infectious, hypnotic opening track \"Singularity\" explores the debate of science vs. religion. As Tim sees it, \"If the scientist was more mystical and had more faith, he'd be farther along as a scientist. If the religious person were more open minded towards science, he would see God in a whole new way.\" \"The Clairvoyant\" is about a metaphysically gifted person coming to terms with his/her responsibility as an artist in that unique and often misunderstood field. The oxymoronic title \"My Selfish Altriusm\" tackles the notion of hypocrisy in religion and in our everyday lives, where both spiritual leaders, and people in general, preach about love and honesty while living very differently away from the pulpit. It taps into the potential for good and bad in all of us. The Dustin song finds Tim coming to terms with life and death - an extension of Broken Poets' philosophy of everything in nature happening without interference and the way we can so easily get in its way. While scientific people look at life through a magnifying glass, Broken Poets' approach is that it's better to pull back and see things a little bit blurry.\n",

    "name": "Everything in Nature",
    "description": "True to its provocative name, the New York launched, Phoenix based band Broken Poets has been breaking exciting ground on the indie modern rock scene over the past six years. In many ways, however, the band's founder, singer, songwriter and guitarist Tim McDonald is a throwback to an era when lyrics were king and fans craved songs that pierced the soul and could change the world. One critic said it best about the tunes McDonald brings to life with his Broken Poets partner, classically trained Russian pianist, keyboardist and vocalist Lana Antropova and a revolving series of top sidemen: \"Soulful poetry turned into song, rock ? roll and introspection all in one.\"\n\nPerfectly reflecting this vision, their fourth full length CD Everything In Nature is centered around and dedicated to promoting a more global consciousness about our relationship to nature and ourselves. Putting their money where their mouth is, McDonald and Antropova are donating 50% of the profits from the recording to three major organizations: NDRC (Natural Resource Defense Council), Greenpeace and the human rights organization OXFAM. For this release, Broken Poets incorporated the style and expertise of session drummer Russ Phaneuf to complete their new sound.\n\nWhile thier album Reincarnation took listeners on a spiritual journey through the many facets of one man's life, Everything in Nature finds McDonald digging deep into his personal philosophy and contemplating life's deeper meanings. \"I like to joke that as a songwriter, I am prone to thinking way too much,\" he says, \"but I grew up with my older brother and sister force feeding me all the great singer-songwriters from the 60's and 70's who were also very contemplative writers. I think the standards for lyric writing were much higher in those days, and even though I didn't really 'get it' back then, I guess it set the bar high for the songwriter and storyteller I would become.\n\nHe continues, \"The questions that inspired Everything In Nature were, what is life about? What am I doing with it? I started looking at nature and it hit me that plants and trees start off with seeds that simply evolve into what they're destined to become. We're the only living things on the planet that can question how we grow and because of that awareness, we need to take responsibility for both ourselves and nature. That initial idea spurred most of the songs on the album, and I feel grateful that I was able to write good songs from this idea that our place in the world involves a commitment to preserving the natural world. Every project I've launched with Broken Poets seems to draw from a different theme within my personal philosophy.\"\n\nThe album title comes from a key line in the opening track \"Love For What's Real,\" where McDonald sings, \"Everything in nature has its own will.\" That track, like many of his songs, are written in six-eight time, which he calls \"uncool yet cool\" compared to most rock tunes that are composed in four-four. \"To Dream Of Another Life\" is another six-eighter that was inspired lyrically by listening to classic Bob Dylan. Dylan finds his way into the title of another provocative piece, the anti-misogyny track \"Last Resurrection of the 1st Bob Dylan,\" which playfully addresses the legend's many creative incarnations.\n",

The first track has a smooth surface like ice, slick and cold, shivering patterns of repeated rhythms. It is hypnotizing; the trance is crystallized by the flute call, independent and alone.\n\nOp. 24 - tension of the day, breaking away to bits of comfort but always returning to the worries, time passing by without any consideration of plans and dreams I have for the day.\n\nPrecious Summer Day - ah, summer is a relaxed and easy going state of mind. The piano clusters of sound reminds the day to not be so serious.\n\nSailing Clouds, floating by on their way to something bigger, powerful, but for now distant wisps and puffs, looking so comfortable and inviting. The majestic castles are now passing by, a caravan traveling so high, sometimes looking menacing, but also regal.\n\nSweet Home is a quiet place with orchards and birds, music is created in rooms but cannot be contained by mere walls, always floating into the flowers and trees, bringing the connection of all living things together as one. The bass flute melody is a caress to those who are loved and dear who live here.\n\nWinters End has swirling winds and dark skies that keep the warmth of the sun away for days. Looking out the window, the bare trees and seamless clouds of gray keep the chill inside me. The flute song is the struggle to survive...\n\n...and the only saving grace is Dreaming of Spring, when the growth and warmth returns, bringing hope of spring with storms that rumble through with sweet rain. I can feel myself start to grow as everything begins the upward journey. As I hope to do one day, the flowers blossom with beautiful colors and warmth. If you listen carefully, you can hear the bird calls and warm sun-kissed breezes inviting us closer to summer.\n\nAs with all my music, enjoy your own journey and discoveries - here are mine.\n",

    "description": "In A Cosmic Daze\n\nMusic is our way of expressing ideas that, for whatever reason, cannot be totally expressed or understood in any other forum. We all have had the experience of listening to music that has touched us, but we really can't say why and so we go on about our day effected and somehow changed. If you try to \"demystify\" music you might say that it is a collection of frequencies vibrating in certain patterns and even on that level it is connected with our universe. Scientist talk about string theory and how all things are vibrating strings of energy that make up the cosmic symphony that is our physical world, so it is no wonder that music has such a huge part in our daily lives. This collection of songs is a musical metaphor of how time presents itself to us.\n\nIf you have ever waited, in great anticipation, for someone to arrive or something to happen then you know that sweet emotion that might take pages of text to explain but music can evoke that feeling in a few seconds of listening. Bach's music makes us feel unwavering power of life by a steady tempo and sure relentless melody. Music that is slightly behind the beat makes us feel as though we want to hold time back, like when someone must leave soon, but we want them to stay just a bit longer. This collection explores those ideas.\n\nWith out clocks, the Celtic people had a keen idea of the passing and metering of time. They regarded the \"time between times\" as magical moments to be cherished. These hours were dusk and dawn, solstice and equinox. Although in our lives we have clocks, cell phones and computers telling us the current time and day, it is important to have a few hours to let that go and sit and smell the rain and let the stress of the week go.\n\nMusic can do so much for us as your week builds from Monday through Sunday, these pieces can give you some quiet time to breath and to find joy. Though music we can all relax in our time between times and reconnect to the cosmos in a real human way.\n",

The sweet smell of a crisp sunny day. Leaning on a fence, watching clouds float across an evening sky, shades of grey, rose, and yellow ebbing away as the sun descends into the horizon.\n\nA mare and foal settling down for the night. Close, silent, nuzzling each other to make sure each ones place of sleep is shared and safe. Moonlight drifting over barns and silos. Touching each hillock with it's translucent light. A lake in moonlight. Fading diamonds sparkling their last light before the darkness sips them up and away. Warm honey dripping from a sleeping child's fingertips. A blissful smile at the edge of her mouth, puffs of air barely moving the whisps of hair lying across her cheek.\n\nA darkened sky at the very edge of daybreak. Still. Vacant. The faint promise of light at the edge of the land. Trees barely seen. Grasses unmoving. Flowers yet to bloom. Softness and gentleness resting in the sighs of the earth yet asleep. Nothing astir, no roaming or movements yet of fawns lying under sheltering cover. The edge of night closing around a cottage small. Golden light flickering through curtains drawn, the beginnings of night's dance toward the dawn. Chimney smoke escaping into the frigid air. White against the midnight sky. Disappearing upwards, curling, spirals, then gone. A father's peek into his son's darkened room.\n\nThe sound of the child's dreams once caught on a fright, then released in play. Silent quivers under lids tightly closed. The only sign of dreams forming and fading within a child's heart.\n\nWritten for Cari Live by Britt O'Hollaren\n",

Could it be that it might be the last unanswerable question?

    "description": "Caustic Casanova are eclectic, electric, and hard. The manner in which they channel heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and quirky songwriting into this original and at times unpredictable album is not to be trifled with. Play VERY LOUD for best results.\n\nHere is the very long, weird and literary version of album notes, in the form of a letter to the Magnatune listener:\n\nTremulous grew my mistrustful heart when of a cold and dark evening not some time ago did there come a knocking most exigent at the grand door of my family's estate may long it prosper and suffer forfeiture of monies at only the slimmest of taxation rates. As the hour was such as suits only earthbound spirits and those most desperate brands of hooligans, the household all had retired to their chambers for a night's restorative slumbers save mineself, who, unable to taste that sweetness of a momentary respite from consciousness, had, as is oft my want in times of harrowing solicitousness and incapacitating encumbrance, sought safe haven and refuge in the comforting bosom of my beat lab may long it prosper and yield fruits bearing only the slinkiest of grooves all borne in the name of sweaty, pulsating bodies and so accordingly 'twas I tasked with the chore of answering this unnerving mesonoxian summons. For a solitary moment doth I waver upon the threshold of my Kingdom of Sound; yet with a flourish forth ventured I.\n\n'Twas a cloaked figure I greeted at the gate with prudence. Verily I tell thee, what a vexing sight! No features could I discern, to no vestige of form could I affix a common humanity; still, a strange and unchecked calm did I feel washing o'er mine heart in spite of my sensible mind's sizable alarm. This inscrutable soul held aloft in one hand a flourishing torch, as if some substantial journey was in medias res and this incandescence was a friend, lover, and guide, all entwined in one; cradled in the nook of the other arm was a package. With nary a word did this wraith pass to me this bundle so sacredly carried, before departing with burdened purpose and immediacy from whence it had come.\n\nReturn to the friendly confines of the beat lab doth I, and to the task of deciphering the nature of that curious artifact which in mine hands I held I set. 'Twas a lovely creation, shot through with all of heaven's most alluring shades, the richest of melancholy indigos and wistful violets, bearing as caption the queer cipher:\n\nCAUSTIC CASANOVA SOMEDAY YOU WILL BE PROVEN CORRECT\n\nPartnered with this striking piece of art found I a letter. 'Twas a charter from the governing members of one Mad Love Records granting mineself sole proprietorship o'er the crafting of a treatise heralding the essence of this \"album\" to the fervent patrons of Magnatune. Harrumph, doth I humphed. What a rude and uncivilized gesture, so unbefitting a gentleman of my substantial station may long I prosper and concoct hypnotic rhythms that will populate Swiss raves with beautiful people 'til nigh eternity to receive an unsolicited commission of this nature! And at such an unholy hour in such a haunting fashion! Most nonplussed doth I find mineself, yet, being a man of reason and not inconsiderable learning I took no rash action in the fires of my distemper, and instead proceeded to perform the only rational action the moment afforded: Upon the mercy of my beat lab's absolute world class sound system I placed the fate of this mysterious record, come what judgment may.\n\nNinety-five one-hundredths of an hour later stirred I from what surely be the most magical and splendid moments of mine two ears' existences may long they prosper and share with me regal riffs and magisterial melodies. O, I swear to thee, such music! Such contradictions! Felt I pummeled and uplifted, ransacked and soothed, moved in body and mind, all from the same orchestra's concoction!\n\nAnd so now gather I my thoughts on this radiant LP, so deftly recorded and engineered by Sir J. Robbins may long he prosper and set loose his magpies' songs upon the globe so expertly mastered by Baron Bob Weston may long he prosper and succeed in every Mission he undertakes so superbly written and played by Lady Stefanie Zaenker and Lords Francis Beringer and Michael Wollitz may long they prosper and enchant the masses with their holy choral endeavors. Ye who gather here reading these words face a momentous decision: Doth thou spend thy hard earned wages upon these tunes? All I can tell thee, as plainly as do have I in my power, is this: Thou, a conjurer of worlds, a creator of portals, a grasper of procurements from the great beyond, Use thy Magic Machine to call forth from dimensions yet unconquered these gallant arias, that thine great halls might too be filled with commanding canticles eve after glorious eve, that thou might yet become a better, more harmonious soul on account of what thou encounters here.\n\nYours In Ever Faithful Devotion To The Bounteous Glories Beheld In The Sphere Of Independent-Minded Rock, Leonard Calvert\n",

Prior to, The Space Between, Lawson's release, The Piano (2011), reached #19 on iTunes Classical. Chad has been a featured guest on NPR's Talk of the Nation, PRI/SiriusXM's Bob Edwards Show, toured with Julio Iglesias and can be heard on Delta Airlines In-Flight radio programming.\n",

    "description": "\"I can't put into words what your music expresses; it is far more than beautiful,\" states one YouTube commenter about pianist Chad Lawson's latest offering, Song of Prayer.\n\nVisiting Seattle in July 2011, \"the Lord really laid it on my heart to record something that people could use during prayer,\" Chad recalls. Lawson invited a close friend to record him, let the Lord place his hands wherever He wanted to and 32 minutes later, it was done... No preparation, no outtakes, no overdubs: improvisational prayer in its rawest, most honest form. (Lawson kept a hymnal with him on the piano while recording \"just in case\" but he never had to open it).\n\nLawson never planned on recording this, it found him: Chad plays three morning services every Sunday at a large church in North Carolina. Each service has some time set aside for quiet prayer, where Lawson plays solo. After one quiet time, as soon as the pastor started speaking, Lawson was stunned: \"There was an authority in his prayer, a genuine crying\" not with loud action, but with sincere words.\" Lawson found out he had been reading directly from the Puritan book of prayers and meditation, Valley of the Vision. The inspiration for \"Song of Prayer\" was born.\n",

    "description": "Chad Lawson's solo piano album, Summer Suite, strikes an evocative balance of musical flow and visual metaphor. With economical accompaniment from percussionist Jim Brock, Summer Suite unfurls in ten suite-like movements that mirror not only the passage of the season, but in a deeper sense the passage of time, and how themes of mediation, rumination, freedom and play can provide comfort, solace, and release.\n\nEntirely improvised in a lone 31 minute session, Summer Suite appeals to listeners in a personal way, each one able to add their unique interpretation as the album evolves. To some, touches of a Bach fugue or a Bobby Timmons like jazz cadence will be felt, to others, a rolling, Americana styled melody or East European folk song will come to mind. There are also moments of twilight absorption, where stillness and meditation are as powerful as a flurry of notes cascading across the musical landscape.\n\n\"Lawson pulls off something tricky with Summer Suite, engrossing the listener with simple, involving melodies while also freeing him or her to let their minds roam. Freedom is key as with the best memories of summer.\"\n- Ken Micallef, DownBeat\n",

    "description": "Canto y Danzais a program of songs and dances of Spain. For the first time since the 16th century, a matched set of four vihuelas can be heard to play the polyphonic instrumental fantasias and vocal music from the golden age of the Spanish Renaissance.\n\nThe music for this program has been taken from all of the seven surviving books of vihuela music, with at least one piece from each book being represented. Soprano Carrie Henneman Shaw is the featured singer with Edward Martin, Phillip Rukavina, Rockford Mjos, and Tyler Kaiser playing the vihuelas.\n\nThe vihuela is a guitar-like instrument that was developed and used in Spain during the 16th century. The most popular stringed instrument in Europe was the lute, but, because of the association of the lute with the Moorish population in Spain, the Spanish musicians were not allowed to use the lute. In order to compose and play the polyphonic music that was popular in the day, they developed an instrument that was tuned and played like a lute, but did not look like a lute: and the vihuela was born.\n\nThe music on this recording is adapted from works that survive in the sixteenth-century printed vihuela books. There is at least one piece from each of the surviving seven sources, and ten of the seventeen works include voice, sung by Carrie Henneman Shaw. The arrangements have been made by ensemble member Tyler Kaiser, closely modelled on the music of the original tablatures, constructing the instrumental parts with reference to the original vocal music where relevant, following principles learned from study of the Vallet lute quartets, and applying embellishment drawn from theoretical sources such as Diego Ortiz's Tratado de glosas of 1553. The six pavanas of Luis Milan (tracks 1, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 15) have been converted from solo pieces to ensemble works with glosas added and represent the kind of solemn dance music that was used as processionals in formal entries in Spanish courts and households, as well as for social dancing.\n\nFull song translations, program notes and a description of the instruments can be found in the accompanying artwork.\n",

    "name": "Element",
    "description": "Element is the sixth full-length album by Montreal based duo Chiwawa (Laurie Gordon and Krassy Halatchev). It is comprised of 12 intricately woven and thematically connected songs.\n\nThe opening track What Day Is Today sets the mood for a hypnotic listening experience. What follows is a consistently intriguing adventure taking with unpredictable turns and direction, combined with mature musical aesthetics.\n\nElement carries a positive outlook and reminiscence, full of emotional depth, resonating long after the record has ended. The compositions flow in a light-hearted sort of fashion but the layers beneath evoke serious and compelling thoughts, emotions and contrasts.\n\nChiwawa has written a very personal album. But even more so this time, for it taps into sensitive and delicate topics. My Heart (track 5), Another Moment (track 6) and Carry It On (track 7) are aimed directly at deep and personal experiences (Laurie's loss of her father, when she was only a year-old and Krassy's farewell with his mother, as he left the Iron Curtain in 1990).\n\nIt Better Be True (track 8) is the hooky first single which has that je-ne-sais-quoi quality, making you want to push the Repeat button, repeatedly.\n\nMoonlight Dancer (track 2) carries a Gorillaz-esque care-free feel and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Yet, lyrically it demonstrates that special bond Laurie and Krassy share. Both songs celebrate the duo's 20-year relationship and musical partnership.\n\nElement is charged, rich, and captivating. It is a mature, brilliantly composed and meticulously crafted collection of songs that is certain to leave a long lasting impression.\n\nIt is no surprise that critics hurried to proclaim it as \"Chiwawa's best to date!\"\n",

From the neo British invasion ballad (track #3 - The Beatles meet Blur) to the enigmatic force of Cinderella (Talking heads meet Nina Hagan, having tea with the B52's in the love shack), it has a little bit of a lot and is a true culmination of their unified vision and singular goal.\n\n\"Watermark\" is the last installment from Chiwawa, released in 2010. The album gets off to a swirling lyrical start with \"Runaway Train\", a moving ode to the swell of emotion that carries you in its slipstream towards your bliss. A driving beat to hurry you along the journey, an almost hypnotic journey.\n\nIt is followed by a quietly anthemic techno march called \"Chasing clouds\" - a futuristic, moody and melodic splash of reality-check. \"...we are blinded by shiny things... we try to dive back into the dream... we just may see the real is surreal\". It is hauntingly poetic.\n\nThe featured co-singles are \"Calma Calma\" and \"Don't Twist My Mind\".\n\nThe former is a smooth euro-pop/world beat offering with an almost impossible to not sing along to hook that resonates long after the chorus has faded away. A chant or mantra to keeping one's head.\n\nThe latter is an old fashioned bluesy funk plea to come along for the ride, to do what it takes to keep it together going down the road. The harmonics of the vocals are mirroring the message. Just keep it going. Great open-road with the top down cruising music.\n",

    "description": "Music by J. S. Bach for unaccompanied violin and keyboard is presented here for the first time in these dazzling and virtuosic transcriptions for solo flute, along with Bach's only original work for the instrument, the Partita in A minor.\n\nHaving grown up in the era of 'switched-on' Bach, Chris Britton has long enjoyed playing Bach transcriptions on the flute. Bach himself was a great arranger of other composers' works, as well as his own. He was also clearly a great fan of the transverse flute (only then coming into its own as a solo instrument), to judge by the demanding and extensive parts he wrote for it in his great choral works, concertos and chamber music. Chris uses the modern Boehm-system flute rather than the Baroque traverso to cope with the large range of notes and expression required for the violin partitas and keyboard preludes. With judicious use of tone, phrasing and vibrato a bridge is formed between authentic Baroque interpretation and modern flute-playing.\n\nThe flute on this disc shows itself capable of much more than melodic interpretation: the suggested harmony and counterpoint of many instrumental lines also come within its grasp. The complex richness of Bach's music finds true expression on the humble flute, the purest and most ancient of instruments, thanks to technical progress and virtuosity.\n\nRecorded by John Buckman for ToneGnome Audio Engineering\n",

    "description": "Sub-Conscious is an enjoyable album featuring a mix of modern and traditional timbres, beats and influences. By allowing each of his various influences to come to the forefront, Field creates a sophisticated and exciting musical journey.\n\nField begins with the dreamy \"Floating.\" Soaring strings, interlaced with a steady rock beat, make this opening song one of the most interesting tracks on the record.\n\nThe piece \"Days\" features a rich layering of strings, combined with a steady groove, giving the album a Neo-Classical feel. Also notable is Field's interpretation of \"Ave Maria.\" Here, he introduces choir alongside percussion, electronic keyboard, and a grooving drum beat, bringing a fresh take to this classic work.\n\nField does a great job of blending tradition with innovation as he brings a fresh and exciting treatment to a much-loved classic. Even those listeners who are unfamiliar with the piece's origins can enjoy the work as much a seasoned classical listeners.\n\n\"Five,\" which features a 5/4 time signature and ostinato piano pattern, is an example of Field adding some cinematic flare to his writing. The orchestration is highly effective, with the soaring strings, distorted guitar work and piano all working together to create an atmosphere that goes beyond a simple melodic and harmonic statement. This is where film music is so successful, in using melodies, timbres and instrumental combination to evoke a strong response from the listener, without bringing lyrics into the equation.\n\nOn other tracks, Field brings more of a House-Dance influence into his writing, such as the groove and instrumentation on \"D ? A.\" Here, we find the composer using strings as part of the arrangement, but the electronic beats and Fender Rhodes piano work create more of a danceable mood with the track than some of the other works on the album. By mixing things up, bringing in different influences and using interesting instrument combination, Field is not only following his creative instincts, but is providing a diverse listening experience that prevents the album from becoming predictable or monotonous.\n\nA multi-tiered opus, the 14+ minute \"Blue,\" references cinematic strings, after hours jazz, and a multitude of intriguing points between and beyond. By working in familiar territory to his album, Field is not only showcasing his compositional abilities but his talents as an arranger and interpreter of classic works at the same time, something that listeners of all backgrounds and tastes can enjoy.\n\n\"Mother\" and \"Sub-Conscious\" have an other worldly sound - peaceful and relaxing - and bring the listener to an ambient state of mind.\n\n",

    "description": "A blend of styles, soulful song writing, top notch musicianship and crystalline production coupled with Chris Juergensen's dynamic guitar playing makes this album a must for any Fusion lover.\n\nReview:\n\"Prospects is his first release, it is entirely instrumental, and dwells in the mellower moods of jazz, he plays in a similar manner as the likes of Metheny, Stern, Krantz, ? Scofield. That is to say, that his tone on the guitar is very clean, distortion free, with a heavy focus on improvisation. His technique is very clean, and he shows a versatile chord vocabulary as he comps his way through the oft changing progressions in his music.\"\n\n\"He has stated that this cd was recorded in studio, with a live feel, with minimal rehearsals, and hardly an overdub to be found. This is a surprising fact, to have created such a lush and expressive musical statement as this, seemingly would have required more than a couple rehearsals, yet the music sounds very refined, and the sound quality is very clear. He also made a note to tell me that this cd would represent his jazzier side of fusion, and he also has plans to create some rock influenced fusion cds in the near future, and in listening to his playing skills, I certainly look forward to hearing him doing that, as well as getting an opportunity to get a respectable amount of time in studio to complete it.\"\n\n\"Prospects is a very relaxing listen, great late night music to kick back to, and Chris' playing soothes your mind, setting up solo spots with articulated melodies, and just the right amount of ambiance from his band members. It should be noted that this type of fusion is not anything like the style made famous by such guitarists as - John McLaughlin, Scott Henderson or Al DiMeola, where speed, volume, and technical arrangements are the focal points, this music is more in line with what players like Wayne Krantz, John Scofield, or Mike Stern have been doing, very east coast sounding with a huge jazz influence.\"\n-Prognosis\n",

    "description": "The Heart Sutra (in Sanskrit, Prajnaparamita Hrdaya), possibly the best known text of Mahayana Buddhism, is said to be the pure distillation of wisdom (prajna). The precise origin of the Heart Sutra is unknown. The earliest record of the sutra is a Chinese translation from Sanskrit by the monk Chih-ch'ien made between 200 and 250 CE.\n\nAs with most Buddhist scriptures, simply \"believing in\" what the Heart Sutra says is not its point. It is important also to appreciate that the sutra cannot be grasped by intellect alone. Although analysis is helpful, people also keep the words in their hearts so that understanding unfolds through practice.\n\nIn this sutra, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva is speaking to Shariputra, who was an important disciple of the historical Buddha. The early lines of the sutra discuss the five skandhas - form, sensation, conception, discrimination, and consciousness. The bodhisattva has seen that the skandhas are empty, and thus has been freed from suffering. The bodhisattva speaks: Shariputra, form is no other than emptiness; emptiness no other than form. Form is exactly emptiness; emptiness exactly form. Sensation, conception, discrimination, and consciousness are also like this.\n\nThe Heart Sutra continues, with Avalokiteshvara explaining that all phenomena are expressions of emptiness, or empty of inherent characteristics. Because phenomena are empty of inherent characteristics, they are neither born nor destroyed; neither pure nor defiled; neither coming nor going.\n\nAvalokiteshvara goes on to say there is no path, no wisdom, and no attainment. Because no individual being comes into existence, neither does a being cease to exist. Because there is no cessation, there is no impermanence, and because there is no impermanence, there is no suffering. Because there is no suffering, there is no path to liberation from suffering, no wisdom, and no attainment of wisdom. Thoroughly perceiving this is \"supreme perfect enlightenment.\"\n\nThis musical work \"Heart Sutra\" is set to sound and musical vibrations meant to help harmonize the content of the sutra with one's feeling and sense rather than appeal to the analytical and intellectual musings of the listener. The result is a much deeper knowing and oneness of the \"universal void\" in which everything and nothing is contained.\n\nChristopher Currell has employed advanced synthesis and spatial audio techniques to help convey a deeper meaning and understanding of the Heart Sutra. Combining sound colors, advanced polyrhythmic themes and flowing percussive rhythms, Christopher has woven a tapestry of elements that speak to the deeper consciousness. Christopher has taken the information, which is the Heart Sutra, and fused it into an audio wave pattern that connects directly to heart of the listener. In addition, Taiun Matsunami from the Daitoku-ji Ryosen-an temple in Kyoto, Japan provides the exquisitely performed Heart Sutra and other Buddhist chants.\n",

Over the years fragments of revisions were recorded, noted, lost and discovered, rewritten and lost again until 2009 when Christopher made the decision to try and bring all of this material together into one cohesive work.

A densely textured introspective work, saturated in analog synths, punctuated with edgy glitchy beats and samples from the artists childhood tapes and reel to reels, \"Tape\" is a voyeuristic peek into Colfax's nostalgic mind and a \"child in a candy store\" approach to his myriad vintage electronic devices and tape sources.\n\nAmong the key elements in Colfax's work is his use of the legendary Roland Jupiter 8 and the Sequential Circuits Prophet VS synthesizers which were played by hand on this album which give it a raw and human feel. His father used these instruments in the 80's on sessions and so there is a deep connection to their sounds and their origin.\n\nIn 2000, Berkman compiled from dozens of his childhood cassette tapes, a track of just the noisy spaces between the songs and occasionally words and random sounds which he called \"The Sound of Beauty\". Because these snippets weren't songs within themselves and even though they had no context, one could sense the imprint of the time and place they were recorded, as if subliminally. Berkman also found a wealth of material from a box of old reel to reel tapes that also belonged to his father. These tapes were the missing link and Colfax took it's oddly nostalgic shape. Not unlike Boards Of Canada or Freescha, Colfax transports us sonically to a time and place that exists deep within our psychological memory, hiding like a box of forgotten reel to reels, safe from the din of the world yet vulnerable to it's elements.\n",

Their technical difficulty has been a challenge to which innumerable harpsichordists and pianists have risen. But the underlying wit and humour of this amazing work has sometimes been disguised by sheer virtuosity. Again, many have approached the Goldberg Variations in a 20th century spirit of undue reverence and solemnity, at least in the view of Colin Booth.\n\nColin's recording is deeply felt, but more than most performances, also shows the good-naturedness of Bach, and presents the detailed counterpoint which is the basis of the composition, with unusual clarity. You can really hear how the music is made.\n\nIn addition to being a personal account, this album demonstrates some of the discoveries made by Colin during the decade during which he not only worked at this piece, but was writing his in-depth study of Baroque notation: \"Did Bach Really Mean That?\" Both book and album emphasise often-overlooked elements in Bach's music: for example, the great man was a dancer in his spare time, and his music is imbued with dance-rhythm, another feature often left unrevealed in present-day performance.\n",

It presents, in a continuously linked sequence of diverse but musically related pieces, an introspective exploration of mood. Much of the music is improvisation, either actual or in style. Included are the evocative \"Overture to Orpheus\" written in 1981 by Louis Andriessen, and music by three members of the Couperin family: Louis, Francois, and Armand-Louis, in all covering a period of more than one hundred years.\n",

Some were written during the reign of the first Queen Elizabeth, around 1600, and others after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, following the English Civil War and the Protectorate. The pieces by William Croft, a devotee of Purcell, are even later, and some, like those by Tomkins, who had studied with William Byrd but lived into the middle of the seventeenth century, can be said to bridge the gap between the English Renaissance and the Baroque.\n\nThis beautiful new recording, made in 2014, is the first album recording on a newly-restored original 17th century harpsichord.\n\nThose who are particularly interested will enjoy the upper manual (played with the left hand here) being at 4 foot pitch (i.e. an octave higher than notated).\n\nFull liner notes are available with the artwork download to members.\n",

Not only did he becme a famous composer throughout the continent, but his music, unlike his person, was celebrated in his home country. The major source for his keyboard works is the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book - a pioneering English anthology.\n\nPhilips' style is more overtly emotional than that of his English contemporaries. One of the most famous and intense pieces, Pavana Doloroso, is supposed to have been composed while he languished in prison, and his setting of Caccini's song Amarylli Mia Bella, conveys a surprising degree of pathos.\n\nContrasting with these are thrillingly virtuosic works, like the Galliarda Passamezzo, vividly conveying how exuberant dancing could be in the Renaissance period.\n\nColin Booth's album has received enthusiastic praise from English and German reviewers. He plays a large and unusual harpsichord: a copy of an Italian 17thC instrument with two keyboards, now in the collection in Nuremberg, Germany.\n",

    "name": "Commusicare",
    "description": "The works on this classical music recording span the whole 17th century, of which the beginning marks the change from the Renaissance to the Baroque era.\n\nThe bicinia by Pratorius still witnesses the \"old\" style of severely ruled counterpoint (stylus antiquus), whereas the new style (stylus modernus) - based on the same rules - allows a novel kind of freedom to express the meaning of words and affects. Above the Basso continuo, consisting of a bassline and chords, the solo voice(s) unfold. In the \"stylus phantasticus\", to which the sonatas by Pandolfi, Schmelzer, Biber, Buxtehude und Kuhnel belong, this is realized in an extremely free, improvisatory way.\n\nWith our choice of instruments and temperament, and the way we handled the challenges of notation, we tried to fulfill the historical standards in order to emphasize the works' special character as much as possible. For some people gut strings may still sound unfamiliar, but the divergence from today's listening habits offers the chance to enter new musical worlds.\n\nThe music presented here has a special connection to speech and communication: In the bicinia by Praetorius, composed both for singing and playing, two voices of equal rank have a \"conversation\" over a choral: They alternate, imitate each other, propagate words aforesaid, consort with each other, but also face each other with controversial statements - like two partners in a good dialogue. At a first glance it might surprise that this is possible without spoken words. Nevertheless it uses the same means: Interplay of stressed and unstressed \"syllables\" in a certain meter, alternating pitch of the voice, deliberate periods of rest, change of volume or pace of play. Thus the music itself becomes an autonomous language.\n\nIn Buxtehude's trio sonata and Pandolfi's violin sonata such means of expression can be observed clearly: rests, sudden ruptures of sections, which leave the subsequent completely undetermined, opening and closing motifs and repetitions. Repetition plays a special role in the sonatas by Schmelzer and Kuhnel: The repetitive bassline forms a basic structure which gives room to the novel freedom the solo instrument enjoys. They sound like written-out improvisations. Thus the steady form allows fantasy to develop (stylus phantasticus). Also in Biber's sonata we find such improvisatory sections. They alternate with dance forms (passacaglia and gavotte). In the severe, slow introduction all voices move chromatically in half-steps. Still today this appears audacious. A specific feature of this sonata is: The highest string of the violin, normally tuned to \"E\" has to be tuned down a whole step to \"D\". (The retuning process is not part of the album).Without the aforementioned means of expression, which also constitute the base of language, the music would be a senseless sequence of tones. Only through the creation of musical gestures the tones gain some sense, an expression and meaning - otherwise they would be \"meaningless\" like letters failing to form a word, words failing to form a sentence.\n\nEach of us used these means of expression with his or her own instrument (violin, gamba or harpsichord) to create meaningful musical gestures, ultimately yielding a successful interplay in the ensemble. To this end however it is indispensable to listen to each other, to pick up on the others' expressions, to interpret, comprehend them and finally to respond to them. Only then music results in a special form of communication.\n",

This is both a blessing and curse. It's hard to connect with an audience when the artist keeps changing, but that's what I must do.\n\nThe Door is a collection of tracks that reflect my growing command of digital music production and equipment. It's more diverse sonically and contains some very sophisticated sonic effects. What is \"the door\"? That's going to remain a mystery because it's a mystery to me as well. I suppose I like the imagery of a portal...you enter and where you end up on the other side is quite different. I'd like to think that I've landed in a different place as I created this album and I hope you find some meaning in it as well.\n",

    "description": "\"Heartstrings\" was recorded in the spring of 1997.\n\nI had just moved to San Francisco in 1995 and by 1996 I was in my honeymoon period with the Kora. I was 26 and living in North Beach, the perfect place for a beat poet aficionado and aspiring musician to find his voice.\n\nI'd only been playing kora a year but had many requests from friends and family to record a tape. I'd been a drummer, guitarist, keyboardist, composer and singer/songwriter for years and never expected my first release to be on an instrument from West Africa. But all the signs pointed toward a future in the kora.\n\nWhen I bought my first kora from my teacher; guitarist and luthier Alan Perlman, I started learning the traditional songs of the griots right away. I was already hip to the greats like Amadu Bansang Jobarte, Toumani Diabate, Tata Dindin and Alhaji Bai Konte. I listened to these guys obsessively, copied their style, learned of their culture and practiced for hours a day. I got pretty good, too. But I also attached a pickup to the bridge and plugged it in to my guitar effects to create an altogether different kind of music. Everything took off when I bought the Oberheim Echoplex and the Digitech Whammy 2 pedal. Suddenly I was creating other worlds! At the time I was also obsessed with Robert Fripp and his Soundscapes and thought I could approach that type of art form using the kora.\n\nI connected with producer/musician Mark Orton of the Tin Hat Trio through a mutual friend. Mark and I both went to the Hartt School of Music in Connecticut and he was interested in what I was doing with kora and electronics. He was new to the city like me so our approach to the record was very free spirited and creative. I got his Tin Hat Trio their first gig in San Francisco at a tea house called Pure Tea on Polk Street. I had a regular solo kora gig there. Everything was clicking. I had plenty of material and now an awesome recording engineer.\n\nMy friend John Stanley took some black and white shots of me with my kora, sitting on the front steps of my Union Street flat, facing the sun, posing on my rooftop with Alcatraz in the distance. It was a love affair with the kora and with San Francisco.\n\nIn 2008 I decided to go back to the original tapes and add more parts. Over the years I had developed as a composer and had a much more refined pallet of sounds, especially those derived from the kora. I added additional bass and percussion parts taken from knocking, plucking, rubbing and tapping the kora. Then I would pitch shift and tweak these sounds in Logic Pro to make EXS24 instruments out of them. All \"Heartstrings\" needed was a bit more bass and punch. Just enough to really bring the tracks to life. The finishing touch was to have it mastered by none other than David Earl, long time friend and collaborator, genius producer and logic ninja!\n\nThere's one word that comes to mind when I think of my first ever produced record........innocence. Still, when I listen to it today, I feel that all is well. I'm very proud of this little record.\n",

    "description": "The 6 Suites for Unaccompanied Cello (circa 1720) contain a wide emotional range and their intimacy has made them amongst J.S. Bach's most popular works today. Portions of the suites have been transcribed for a great variety of instruments. There have been several transcriptions for the standard 6-string guitar that require transposing the cello score into the higher range of the guitar. Most of the transcribers have liberally added extra bass notes and harmonies to \"enhance\" the comparatively sparse cello score.\n\nDaniel Estrem's recordings of the first three suites are in their original keys and are read from the original bass clef (normally guitar music is written in the treble clef). The extended lower range of the 8-string guitar allows the performer to play the same notes as the cello.

    "description": "Bach Cello Suites on 8-String Guitar volume 2\nDaniel Estrem's recording of Bach's Cello Suites 6,5 and 4 are in their original keys and, as with Estrem's recording of Suites 1-3, are the same notes that would be heard on the cello. It is widely believed that Suite 6 (BWV 1012) was composed for a 5-string cello with an added treble string. The note range required in the suite is extensive and it is written in more of a free form than the others, with virtuosic and cadenza-like passages. Suite 5 (BWV 1011) reflects more of a French influence than the other suites. The Prelude is a French overture and the Courante and Gigue are in the French style, rather than the Italian form of the other suites. Bach also wrote a lute version of this suite (BWV 995) so he clearly didn't feel the music had to be loyal to one particular instrument.\n\nSuite 4 (BWV 1010) is technically demanding on both the cello and the guitar since E-flat is a difficult key to play in for both instruments. On this recording an alternative tuning is used which makes the suite more accessible.\n\nThere is a marvellously transformable quality in Bach's music that has much to with his genius and certain aspects of his music sound modern as well as ancient. Musicians are able to reinvent the music using different instruments and sonorities. It's almost as if Bach stands outside of time.\n",

Bach's enormous output of high-quality compositions over a sustained period of time leads one to believe that he had a sense of modesty if not a sense of humor.\n\nJ. S Bach (1685-1750) composed his set of 6 English Suites around 1715 while he was living in Weimar, where his position at the Weimar court required him to write a new cantata every week. As if this wasn't enough to keep him occupied, he wrote these suites to fulfill his desire to create new instrumental music.\n\nHis set of 6 French Suites were composed between 1722 and 1725 and display some of Bach's most popular and accessible keyboard writing. These suites are not particularly \"French\" in idiom, lack preludes, and are shorter and less complex than the English Suites. Both French and English Suites were named at a later time by someone other than the composer. Like Bach's other suites, they follow a largely Italian tradition.\n",

    "description": "J. S. Bach, (1685-1750) a prodigious talent at the keyboard was known for his formidable technique and improvisational skills. His keyboard compositions are widely varied, encompassing the entire course of his lifetime. Having never received academic training in composition, he acquired his knowledge of counterpoint and harmony by analyzing the works of others. He studied the music of notable composers of previous generations as well as his European contemporaries. The concertos of Vivaldi profoundly influenced his ideas of harmony and musical form. The first track on this recording (Allegro from Sonata #5) reveals the Vivaldi influence yet bears the indelible stamp of Bach.\n\nBach's music often seems to exist beyond any particular instrument. The same piece of music can work as effectively on a piano as a guitar, as an orchestral arrangement or a choral work.\n\nBach's exploration of harmony delved deeper than many composers of the time and occasionally his music contains surprising dissonance and can transition to unpredictable harmonic areas. It is interesting to note that for someone whose compositions are said to be the basis for Western music, there is no textbook written by Bach. His work stands on its own and has been the source of musical knowledge for many generations.\n",

Bach's compositions take these instruments to their limit by providing an impressive display of what can be done on four strings, while reflecting a sense of polyphony and harmony.\n\nWithin the mandolin family of instruments the mandolin is the counterpart to the violin and its strings are tuned to the same pitches. It should be noted that the mandolin family's metal strings are doubled (in unison) and generally played with a plectrum. The mandola, on the other hand, has the viola as its cousin and is tuned a fifth lower than the mandolin. Its body and neck are larger than the mandolin and it has a somewhat deeper sound as compared to the treble-sounding mandolin. The mandola, although now less common, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \"little mandola\". This recording employs a somewhat non-traditional approach, as the mandola strings were strung singly which allows for a fingerstyle technique (no plectrum).\n",

Written in the key of D major (B major in this ukulele transcription), it has great melodic leaps and implied harmonies mixed with subtle chords and driving rhythms. The feeling of inner peace and happiness permeate the six movements.\n\nPartita #2 for solo violin in D minor (B minor transcription) consists of 4 dance-like movements followed by the lengthy and marvellous ciaccona (chaconne). These days most listeners equate minor keys with sadness, but it should be noted that this association was a convention more of the later Romantic era than the Baroque. In many cases Bach used the minor key to express such qualities as human nobility and emotional depth.\n\nBach experienced many things in his lifetime (1685-1750), but one thing he didn't experience was great fame. He wrote his many transcendent masterpieces in relative obscurity. One can only wonder if he had any idea of the enormous influence his work would have on musicians and listeners in future eras.\n",

    "description": "Antonio Vivaldi's extensive body of concertos (over 500) spanned a period greater than three decades. L'Estro Armonico, Op. 3, (Harmonic Inspiration) is a collection of twelve concertos for 1, 2, and 4 violins (1711). It achieved instant success and exerted a widespread influence on 18th-century instrumental music. In fact, J. S. Bach was so impressed that he transcribed six of these concertos for various instruments as an expression of his indebtedness. These concertos, two of which are included on this recording (No. 2 and 8) suggest a conscious effort by Vivaldi to forge a new concerto language.\n\nVivaldi's brief Concerto in G Major (Alla Rustica) with its strong allusions to folk music is well-suited to the guitar, which is particularly adept with folk melodies and rhythms.\n\nThe Brandenburg Concertos (1721) by J. S. Bach are widely regarded as among the finest musical compositions of the Baroque era. No two of the six concertos are alike in their instrumentation. The Third Concerto included on this recording is a pure ensemble piece. Between the two rollicking outer movements lies a puzzle that has often perplexed scholars and challenged performers. This second movement labeled adagio, consists of a mere two chords. When played literally it sounds far too short to separate the pulsating and energetic first and third movements. Consequently, many performers (D. Estrem included) opt to insert an appropriate slow movement from another one of Bach's works.\n\nThe Concerto for 2 Violins in D Minor, also known as the Double Violin Concerto is one of the more famous works by Bach. It was written around 1730 and includes one of Bach's most touching and beautiful slow movements.\n",

The music is mainly uncomplicated and intended to be performed with minimal rehearsal time. Mozart writes about \"the rehearsal\", with the implication that his concerts would only have one.\n\nTwo outstanding composers of the late eighteenth century are Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791). They not only wrote in the same idiom, but became personal friends, and each admired and was influenced by the music of the other.\n\nMozart is represented on this recording with the well-known serenade \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\" originally written for small string orchestra. Haydn's \"Baryton Trios\" were composed for a now-extinct instrument playing the lead part. The baryton, a somewhat complicated instrument similar to a large viola da gamba was equipped with an extra set of resonating metal strings for plucking in addition to the main bowed strings. Haydn wrote nearly 200 pieces for the baryton, mostly in trio combination with viola and cello. James Hook (1746-1827) was a lesser-known English composer. His trio performed on this recording is originally for three flutes.

There exists a sensuous quality to his music and it is noted how his compositions often avoid being formed around one key or pitch. His harmonies, abrupt modulations and use of unusual scales (whole-tone and pentatonic) were considered radical in his day, but today sound quite normal as he influenced almost every major composer of the 20th century.\n\nDebussy was a gifted pianist and an outstanding sight-reader, but his true passion was for composition. He frequently challenged the rigid teaching of the Paris Conservatoire and favored dissonances and intervals that were frowned upon at the time. One of his famous quotes is, \"Some people wish above all to conform to the rules, I wish only to render what I can hear. There is no theory. You have only to listen. Pleasure is the law.\" Another is, \"Works of art make rules; rules do not make works of art.\"\n\nThe pieces on this recording are Daniel Estrem's transcriptions of a sampling of Debussy's piano works.

His popularity and recognition during his lifetime appear to be at odds with how he perceived himself. Perhaps he had a realistic view of his place in the panorama of history. His melancholic lyrics and music have often been described as his creation of an \"artistic persona\", for he was actually known to be a mostly cheerful person.\n\nDowland composed some 90 works for solo lute, many of which are dance forms. Melancholy does not dominate this album of Dowland's lute music played on 8-string guitar. The works, instead reflect a variety of moods and settings. It is said that Dowland was musically influenced by his numerous travels to the continent and there are instances in his music that sound like glimpses of the future. In the last 40 seconds of the final track on this album (\"A Fancy\") one can hear the tremelo of Francisco Tarrega's famous guitar piece \"Recuerdos de la Alhambra\" followed by a pattern similar to the one used by Isaac Albeniz in his celebrated \"Leyenda\" (Asturias).

    "description": "Composed in 1723, The Four Seasons stands out as a jewel among Vivaldi's works and is one of the most popular pieces of Baroque music ever written. Each concerto's individual texture and color conjures up images and emotions of its respective season. Vivaldi's Allegros, with their distinctive rhythmic drive and dazzling virtuosic passages offer a dramatic contrast to the hauntingly beautiful melodies of the slow (Adagio and Largo) middle sections.\n\nVivaldi's musical descriptions of different scenes from the seasons are vivid and numerous. A few of the more obvious are the bird calls, the murmuring brook, and the brief stormy weather on track 1 (Spring). The prolonged \"take cover\" storm occurs on track 6 (Summer). A rather primitive peasant dance takes place on track 7 (Autumn) where the country-folk as well as the musicians may have had a bit too much wine during the harvest celebration. Track 8 (Autumn) depicts the hunt with galloping rhythms followed by the sound of the hunting horns (played on bouzouki). The hunted beast runs by in triplets and guns are fired which cause the unfortunate's demise. Track 10 and 12 (Winter) imitate the shivering and teeth-chattering features of the great outdoors, whereas the lovely Largo (Track 11) lets us feel how nice it can be to stay indoors by the fire when the winds are howling outside.\n\nBaroque composers were constantly reusing their own music and adapting it for different instruments and purposes. It should be noted that the Baroque era was home to a multitude of plucked-string instruments. Daniel Estrem's instrumentation of 6 and 8-string classical guitars, steel-string acoustic guitar, ukulele, and bouzouki is unconventional and offers the listener an experience of hearing a timeless classic in a whole new setting.\n",

    "description": "Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) was an Austrian born composer who spent his life as a court musician somewhat secluded from the rest of the musical world. He was named Kapellmeister at the palace of the influential Esterhazy family in 1761, a position that would support him financially for nearly 30 years. Despite his isolation he was one of the most celebrated composers of his time and the seclusion, as he put it, \"forced him to become original.\"\n\nMuch of Haydn's composition at the time followed the specific musical interest of his patron Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy. The Prince, around 1765 obtained and learned to play the baryton, an unusual instrument similar to the bass viol but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. The instrument on the cover of this recording is the Prince's baryton. Haydn was required to provide new music for the Prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, of which the most notable are the 126 baryton trios, written for baryton, viola and cello. The Londoner Trio No. 1 was originally written for 2 flutes and cello. All transcriptions for guitar by Anton Hoeger (Germany).\n",

    "description": "This album consists of three of the Suites for Unaccompanied Cello by JS Bach performed on the mandola, which is tuned an octave higher than the cello and played with the fingers rather than a bow. Albert Schweitzer made the famous statement that Bach often appears to be writing for some theoretical \"universal\" instrument rather than a specific instrument.\n\nMystery surrounds the cello suites. Unlike Bach's solo violin works, no original manuscript has been found although copies exist. As a result, many interpretations of the cello suites have been made with no sole accepted version. The cello suites are thought to be written around 1720, about the same time as the solo violin Sonatas and Partitas. The original violin solos were found not in Bach's native Saxony, but in Petersburg, Russia some 90 years after his death. They were almost used as cheap secondhand wrapping paper in a butcher shop. Fortunately an astute customer decided to investigate the origin of the manuscript. It has been posited that perhaps the next customer didn't consider what was given to him as wrapping paper and used the original cellos suites as a fire-starter in his hearth.\n",

    "name": "Ravel on Guitar and Ukulele",
    "description": "Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) is one of the dominating figures of French music. His estate currently earns more royalties than that of any other French composer. He was born in the Basque region of France close to the border with Spain. His mother was of Basque descent and grew up in Madrid, Spain, while his father was a Swiss inventor and industrialist. Spanish elements are frequently present in Ravel's work and it's said that he was fascinated with everything Spanish. On this recording the Habanera (track 2) and the Chanson Espagnole (track 16) are clear examples of this influence.\n\nRavel's composing style was innovative and took a different direction than the atonality that attracted many of his contemporaries. Instead, he used modal melodies and applied the aesthetics of the French school of Satie, Chabrier and Debussy. He revered JS Bach throughout his life and placed a high importance on melody, stating that there is \"an implied melodic outline in all vital music\". His composing method was craftsman-like and perfectionistic. The intricacy and precision of his work was summed up by Igor Stravinsky who once referred to Ravel as \"the most perfect of Swiss watchmakers.\"\n\nOn this recording Daniel Estrem performs his own transcriptions which are aimed at being as true to the written score as possible. The classical ukulele is used on sections of Pavane pour une infante defunte (Pavane for a Dead Princess -track 4). When heard on plucked instruments the piece has an ancient aura, as if played on the Greek lyre and harp. The ukulele is also used throughout Ma Mere l'Oye (Mother Goose Suite -tracks 6-10). The childlike voice and timbre of the ukulele could hardly be more appropriate for this set of pieces that portray scenes from fairy tales. At the same time Ravel was writing the innocent Mother Goose Suite he was working on the devilishly difficult Gaspard de la nuit (Demons of the Night). The middle movement, Le Gibet (The Gallows -track 11) reveals a darker side of Ravel and decidedly deals with some end-of-life issues. There is the relentless toll of the bell throughout the entire piece. The influence of the writings of Edgar Allan Poe can be felt and even though the scene is macabre there exists a haunting beauty.\n",

    "description": "Classical guitarists have been attracted to Scarlatti's sonatas because many of them are idiomatic and sound natural on plucked instruments. It should be noted that the sonority of the plucked string is the natural home of the Baroque sound. Lutes, harpsichords, theorbos, spinets, Baroque guitars and harps all generate sound like the classical guitar and ukulele of today.\n\nDomenico Scarlatti (1685-1757) lived the first half of his life in Naples, Italy and moved to the Iberian Peninsula in 1720, where he remained until his death. His first appointment was at the Royal court in Lisbon, Portugal. A decade later he moved to Madrid and took a position at the Royal Spanish court and it was here that the majority of his 550 harpsichord sonatas were written and where his artistic personality began to flourish. Using his imagination, he tested the limits and possibilities of the harpsichord resulting in compositions that surpassed his contemporaries in their originality and experimentation. His expansion of keyboard technique and virtuosity have more in common with keyboard music written a century after his death. Chronologically, he is classified as a Baroque composer, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style.\n\nScarlatti's encounter with the Spanish culture had a profound effect on his compositions. The influence of folk music, the use of modes and other tonal inflections were more or less alien to European art music of the era. Many of his chord patterns and dissonances are suggestive of the guitar. The eminent harpsichordist and musicologist Ralph Kirkpatrick said, \"As far as we know, Scarlatti never played the guitar, but surely no composer ever fell more deeply under its spell.\"\n",

The sonatas heard on this recording are from the Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin. The instrument used is a tenor ukulele with an unconventional tuning that has the same intervals as the violin (fifths).\n\nBach wrote these works around 1720 while he was Kapellmeister at the court of Anhalt- Cothen and with this collection firmly established the technical capability of the violin as a solo instrument. It is speculated that Bach himself gave the first performance. According to his son C.P.E. Bach, \"in his youth, and until the approach of old age, he played the violin cleanly and powerfully.\" It was during this period that he also composed the Brandenburg Concerti, the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Six Cello Suites.\n\nThe Sonatas and Partitas were first published in 1843, nine decades after the composer's death. The original manuscript was famously saved after nearly being used as butcher paper.\n",

Each of these composers used the folklore of his country in his own unique manner. Most of the attention on this recording centers on de Falla and Granados, while Estrem's first Colors of Spain album consists mainly of works by Albeniz.\n\nDe Falla's El Amor Brujo (Love, the Magician) was initially commissioned in 1914-15 as a gitaneria (gypsy piece) by a flamenco gypsy dancer and reflects the composer's skillful use of flamenco elements in shaping this highly original suite. It was later re-scored as a symphonic suite and eventually became a one-act ballet.\n\nEnrique Granados was thoroughly imbued with romantic culture and continued composing in the manner of Chopin and Schumann. He was an exquisite colourist and gave his works a poetic view of a refined 18th century Spanish culture. His Valses Poeticos reveals the expressive nature of his compositions and his thorough mastery of the waltz form.\n",

He lived a relatively long life extending into the early Classical Period, and despite declining health in his later years, he continued to compose music of the highest quality until the evening of his death.\n\nTelemann's music was one of the driving forces behind the late Baroque and early Classical styles. His music gradually changed over the years incorporating more and more elements of the galant style, however he never completely adopted the ideals of the early Classical Period. Telemann's style remained contrapuntally and harmonically intricate, and already in 1751 he dismissed much contemporary music as too simplistic. One can hear examples on this recording where the piece begins sounding almost Haydn-like and then gradually becomes more densely polyphonic and complex.\n\nTranscriptions for guitar by Anton Hoeger (Germany).\nCover art image courtesy of velo_city on flickr.com\n",

His three-part (fast-slow fast) concertos are known for their vitality, color, quick rhythms and syncopation in the fast (allegro) movements, separated by a slow (largo) lyrical movement.\n\nVivaldi infused his concertos (over 500) with constant variation and a certain amount of unpredictability. Even though many of his works sound naturally symmetrical, he often plays with phrase lengths and frequently confounds our expectations. The celebrated wisecrack that Vivaldi wrote the same concerto hundreds of times (attributed to Dallapiccola and repeated by Stravinsky) is humorous, but few people find it believable today. The idea is true only in the most superficial sense and ignores the considerable invention of his work.\n",

After much experimentation, they settled on the \"d minor\" tuning system on an instrument with 11 sets of single and double strings (\"courses\") tuned f' d' a' f d a g f e d c. Once the \"Sun King\" turned his attention to the previously low brow guitar and elevated it to royal status, the lute fell out of favor. Performers spread throughout western Europe into the mostly German speaking countries and began to fuse the contemplative cerebral \"broken\" style of the French lutenists with more Italian influences that emphasized melody (Cantabile) and counterpoint while retaining the popular French dance music forms. In the later German baroque, two additional bass courses were added (b and a) and the music increased in harmonic complexity.\n\nThe program on this album is an exploration of this rich and underappreciated repertoire, performed on both 11 course and the later 13 course baroque lute. The 11 course music retains much French influence with separated chords and simple harmonies but introduces more melodic components. The 13 course music introduces the singing cantabile style leading to the complex harmonies and grandeur of Weiss and Bach. Finally, a modern composition by Turovsky shows that the \"German\" baroque lute has not sung its last new songs.\n",

The concept for these tracks was to take the idea of creation, the act of being creation and turning it into a spiraling, chaotic, yet controlled piece - with so much haste to reveal the creation that unraveled itself into this world. BeIng is that very unraveling - the curtain call for Be Creative. Images of a human discovering the body they reside in kept running through my mind while composing and hearing it.\n\nBe Joy is a circular piece - a mantra. The two sections always constantly becoming one another. Composing this, I knew it was right to go to the opposite section when my craving for it could not wait any longer.\n\nBe True formed first among the other pieces and personally, it sounds like it. It's an infant, playful, peaceful, and full of joy. Yet, some noises may give you a hint at another thought. While the melody if easy to listen to, the rolling and sweeping sonics that appear in the background hint at a different understanding of truth all together.\n\nBe Alive is passion. Full of peaks and valleys. A sonic land scape. By far the hardest piece to manifest for the series of pieces. I only recorded parts for this track when completely in the mindset of intense passion. Those beautiful vocals are front man from Glowing House, Steve Varney.\n\nBe Different and Be Something are minimalistic. These two are miles apart from Be Alive on the sonic landscape, yet polar opposites on one another. Be Different sings to the earth while Be Something chants to the ocean. Ying and Yang but folding into each other.\n\nBe Hope, the cousin of Be Alive. Brimming with life, but with a twist. This is the manifestation of Hope - where none exists.\n",

David Gilden plays kora and synthesizer with guest musicians: John \"Mr. Bones\" Burrell on bones and Ron Lister on concertina.\n\nThe music presented on Distant Strings comes from several mid 80s recording sessions that took place in Boston. Featured are tracks of my first recordings from my first albums, 'Kora I' and 'Kora II'. These were originally released between 1984 and 1985 on cassette.\n\nIn 1986 I went back into the studio to record additional tracks for the release of Jato and Distant Strings. The music on Distant Strings and Jato was thoroughly remastered by a top mastering engineer in NYC. Low Level noise (pops ? clicks) have been painstaking removed, endings have been cleaned up, the track to track ambiances have been balanced.

The subtle beats return with \"Mirrored Image\" by Cargo Cult?an irresistable track by Cargo Cult. Next comes the tabla seduction of \"Dance of the Aisles\" and the understated poetics of \"Arabesque\" by Hans Christian. We especially like the atmospheric \"Waddi Jah\" by Rapoon, which blends what sounds like 1920's Indian radio broadcasts with fizzy, floaty ambient loops.\n",

    "name": "La Cetra Galante",
    "description": "The Galant style seeks an elegant and noble simplicity that is refined, charming and graceful. The emphasis is on a pleasing, attractive melody, only lightly ornamented and lightly accompanied. The Galant style is also known as Rococo, from the French word rocaille, meaning shell, and is taken from an almost contemporary movement in Fine Arts characterized by decorative surface work such as scrolls or shells. This emphasis on surface features has led some to view the style, or even the entire period, as one of superficiality. Charles Rosen, for example, in The Classical Style, describes Johann Christian Bach's music as \"formal, sensitive, charming, undramatic, and a little empty.\" Running parallel with the Enlightenment, the Galant style would seem to contrast with a philosophy that celebrated Reason and humanity's ability to perfect itself and thus society. However, for Reason to triumph and perfection to be achieved, emotion cannot be allowed to rule. A certain distance comes into play where emotion is acknowledged and felt but is not paramount, thus allowing a path leading to higher thought and true beauty to open. The Galant style embodies this approach, and the cetra, with its shell-like appearance and delicate resonance, is a perfect vehicle for it.\n\nThe guittar or cetra was a popular instrument for domestic music making in the 18th century. Its size and shape, the sonority of its wire strings and open tuning, made it a favorite choice of polite society, and these also answer to many characteristics of the Galant style. As the famous violinist and composer Francesco Geminiani writes in his The Art of Playing the Guitar or Cittra (1760), \"The sweetness and brilliancy of sound peculiar to the Guitar, together with its convenient shape and size, and the easyness of performing on it, has already rendered it extremely fashionable in the polite world: But still it is more deserving of regard, even from good Judges of Music, than is generally apprehended, For the disposition and number of its Strings render it capable of a very full and compleat Harmony.\" In her Lessons and Instructions for Playing on the Guitar (1760), Ann Ford writes of the instrument's gracefulness, \"It has been often wondered at, that an Instrument of this Kind, should, in so short a Time, have become so universal; but had it been in Fashion, when the inimitable Hogarth wrote his ingenious Analysis of Beauty, I doubt not but he would have shewn, that the Attitude this Instrument almost naturally throws the Performer in, is very graceful, and forms the Line of Beauty he so justly has exemplified; not to mention the Advantage which the Hands and Arms are seen in, for, I will venture to affirm, a graceful Person cannot, sitting down, be placed in a more becoming Attitude.\" Like Miss Ford, Geminiani also mentions the cetra's quick rise to fame: \"The use of the Lessor Guitar or Citera, being lately revived amongst us.\" While harkening back to the popularity of the cittern in 16th and 17th centuries, he points to a more contemporary event: the United Kingdom's new Queen. Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenberg-Strelitz played the cetra and the keyboard, and reportedly performed \"God Save the Queen\" on her cetra during the rough, eight-day channel crossing in order to cheer her fellow passengers.\n\nThe cetra seems already to have achieved some fame in the United Kingdom prior to her coronation in 1761, but with such a patron it is small wonder that it became so popular. Johann Christian Bach (b. Leipzig 5 September 1735, d. London 1 January 1782) was Johann Sebastian's youngest child. He went to England in 1762 and shortly thereafter became music master to Queen Charlotte and the royal household. They may in fact have already met at court in Strelitz. It is possible that Bach's Sonata for the Guitar with an Accompaniment for a Violin (c.1770) was composed for the Queen, but there is no dedication.\n\nAlmost nothing is known of Giovanni Baptista Marella, although his music often finds its way into the repertoire of classical guitarists. On thing is certain: he was a champion of the Cetra or Guittar. In the \"Advertisement\" to Sixty Six Lessons For the Cetra or Guittar (op. III, 1762) he writes: \"The great Progress the Cetra or Guittar has made in these Kingdoms within the space of a few years seems a sufficient Recommendation of it; more especially when we consider the disadvantages under which it has hitherto laboured, no less than a total Ignorance of the Power of the Instrument.\" This ambitious work contains music \"in Every key, both Flat ? Sharp\" and is designed to show the cetra \"in its full Extent.\" His Compositions for the Cetra or Guittar (book II, op. IV, 1762), from which the suites performed here are taken, is dedicated to Lady Mary Grey, daughter of the Earl of Stamford. In his dedication to her he writes, \"I believe it will not, in the present Age, be thought necessary for me to say anything in favour of the Instrument for which these pieces were chiefly designed. The vogue it has acquired in England is no more than what It had long since obtained in other parts of Europe. ... And should the Compositions I now lay before your Ladyship conduce to the general Improvement of the Guittar, I shall think my Endeavours sufficiently rewarded. \"Before going to London around 1754, Rudolf Straube (b. Trebnitz 1717, d. London 1785) had sung in the St. Thomas school choir and studied keyboard in Leipzig under the tutelage of J. S. Bach. Straube played the organ and the lute as well as the guittar or cetra. His large collection, Three Sonatas for the Guittar with Accompanyments For the Harpsichord or Violoncello Composed by R: Straube. With an Addition of two Sonatas For the Guittar Accompanyd with the Violin. Likewise a choice Collection of the most Favourite English Scotch and Italian Songs for one and two Guittars of different Authors Properly adapted for that Instrument, Also Thirty two Solo Lessons by Several masters, was published in 1768 by Michael Rauche.\n\nAnother German who had come to London seeking fortune at the court of Queen Charlotte was Fredric Schuman (fl. 1760-80). He played the harpsichord as well as the guittar, and, like Ann Ford, the glass harmonica. He published several collections of lessons and songs for the guittar, some of which were reprinted on the continent. The pieces played here are from A Second set of Lessons For one and two Guittars, op. II. printed and sold by John Johnson around 1765.Carl Friedrich Weideman (d. London 1782) was a famed flautist and composer for woodwinds. Also connected to the court, he published Minuets for Her Majesty's Birthday (1764) as well as several other minuet collections. Weideman's Favorite Minuet for the Harpsichord, Two German Flutes or Two Guittars was published around 1770.Marella mentions that the cetra was popular in other parts of Europe, and in fact one can find versions of the instrument in what is now Germany, The Netherlands and Low Countries, France, and especially in Portugal, due not only to its close ties with England, but, as with the other countries, to the cittern already having a notable history there. Antonio da Silva Leite (b. Oporto 23 May 1759, d. Oporto 10 January 1833) was a teacher and organist as well as a guitarrista. He had studied for the priesthood and composed a great deal of sacred music. He published Six Sonatas de Guitarra in 1792, and his music treatise Estudo de Guitarra, from which Gerado's Toccata and Leite's two minuets are taken, in 1796.The Galant style of the 18th century has its roots in the previous century, notably in France and Italy, where homophonic textures had become increasing popular. Robert de Visee, guitarist to Louis XIV, was a master at writing and setting elegant, pleasing melodies within clean, simple textures. He set this \"Musette en Rondeau\" for both guitar and theorbo, and I have adapted the latter setting for cetra.\n",

A work completely dedicated to his first musical and genuine love: Dub Music.\n\nBass-heavy riddims, advanced delay techniques, deep reverbs for a dubby space are the trademarks of this album. The sounds are rich and tight, the bass is just phat and put forward.\n\nIt is an energetic take, largely instrumental and saturated with delay, reverbs and horns. The organic mix follows the structures of the original Dub of the seventies and eighties. Some field recordings were used in the final mix to create an unique sonic collage.\n\nThe songs were created during different periods and largely were written during the Artist's travels and movements. Collected together, they were mixed and dubbed in the Magic Garden home studio. So it's easy to understand why the album, unconsciously and genuinely, is created and built around the theme of the human journey. A physical and spiritual journey able to free the listener from the bad vibes of babylon.\n\nBass guitar, Drum machines, Sampler, Field recordings, Synths, Keys, Processings, Dubbings, Mixing and Mastering by Dubmaster Conte.\n",

    "description": "This recording represents a unique attempt in the modern discography of lute music to seek out the beauty of the contrepartie, or \"counterpart\", in the French lute tradition.\n\nThe great French lutenists were above all formidable soloists, but often the solo music they wrote was accompanied in manuscript sources by a complementary part (the \"counterpart\") written for a second lute that would add harmony and resonance, and sometimes even extend thematic material, of the solo piece. While the solo piece could always stand alone, the addition of a second lute gives a result that is something rather more than the sum of its parts: sumptuous texture, synergistic sound, and greater compositional robustness, all of which is rare to hear in the modern concert hall.\n\nMartin and Walker felt that the repertoire needed some longer, more involved pieces in addition to the characteristic small dance form prevalent in the repertoire. Seeking to discover a larger scale chaconne for duo turned fruitless, so Gamut Music commissioned Minnesota composer Tyler Kaiser to compose two counterparties; one for the G major Chaconne, the other for the A major Chaconne (Sarabande). He did so in a convincing manner, enhancing each respective piece without changing the character, and keeping in the style of each work.\n\nFinally, a short note about the instruments used for this recording. In order to maximize the balance that is necessary for this remarkably delicate repertoire, the artists are playing an identical matching set of eleven-course French lutes that were specifically made for the recording by the gifted luthier Daniel Larson. The lutes are strung entirely with pure gut strings that were made by Gamut Music, and the nuance, warmth and depth of sound is immediately apparent to the discerning audiophile.\n",

Too often, classical CDs do just what they say on the box, and, whilst they are undoubtedly excellent, I wanted to create something that enabled the listener to engage with the music both musically and personally. I frequently encounter audiences who feel there is a barrier between the classical performer and audience. However, if the performer has taken the time to speak to them and draw them into his or her sound world, then the audience feels much closer to the music and able to appreciate and enjoy the experience in their own way.\n\nTravelling has always fascinated me, and for many of the composers on the album, travel was a source of inspiration. The Romantic era in the 19th century was a time of new horizons being opened up, and seemed the perfect starting point when choosing repertoire. The actual recording process was a breeze, with my husband, Nick Stringfellow overseeing all aspects with a keen ear and infinite attention to detail. For the artwork and liner notes I wanted to make an old travel journal and my good friend Ricardo InsuaCao designed the fantastic cover and booklet, magically coming up with exactly what I had in my head. Scenes of Travel is dedicated to my father, a real traveller in every sense of the world, who encouraged people to think, and think again!\n",

    "description": "Reminiscence is an album with solo acoustic guitar pieces. When I was a teenager, taking classical guitar lessons and discovering acoustic steel-string guitar, guitarist Michael Hedges was my absolute hero. The sounds that Michael Hedges managed to produce from just one acoustic guitar during the 1980's were both unprecedented and awe-inspiring. Many people couldn't believe his solo albums Breakfast in the Field and Aerial Boundaries were recorded without overdubs.\n\nThe music on this album Reminiscence is like a suite with five movements on solo acoustic guitar. The pieces were written between 1994 and 2003 and I tried to create my own magic from what I'd heard on the albums of Michael Hedges and other so-called finger style guitarists like Alex de Grassi.\n\nThis album kicks off with a rather virtuoso prelude and then continues with Reminiscence: a work inspired by memories of my childhood. (While composing this piece, I could almost hear the children's voices on the schoolyard in my mind.) The Peasant Wedding is a lively jig (an Irish dance) and depicts festivities and people dancing from the past. Avond in Schaddeberge is a Dutch title meaning Evening in (the village of) Schaddeberge. A friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to find Schaddeberge on Google Maps, until I told him the village name was made-up. I had used the name in a children's story I was writing. The suite closes with Finale, a rhythmic piece with strumming and percussive effects.\n\nIf you're a guitar enthusiast you can download and play the guitar TABs of this album from MusicaNeo: http://emielstopler.musicaneo.com/sheetmusic/?cat=4599\n",

The title track of this album, Stargazing, depicts an imaginary scene of a lone traveller. He plays his harmonica at a campfire and wonders what life is all about in the deserted wilderness under a wide, star speckled sky. In the background, one can hear the accompaniment of crickets and the crackling of a wood fire.\n\nThe Dutch magazine Muziekwereld reviewed this album and wrote:\n\n\"Emiel Stopler is a talented composer, but on this album, we also hear a gifted guitarist who very accurately plays fingerstyle [guitar], with an impressive sense of detail and timing. The recordings are clear and placed directly in the mix, which does justice to the impressive and atmospheric guitar playing. The repertory is diverse, ranging from pop to ragtime and jazz to latin flavors.\"\n",

    "name": "Footsteps in the Sand",
    "description": "Footsteps in the Sand evolved from Emily's experiences when she was invited to make cultural exchanges in the North East of Brazil. Seeking out tradition and armed with her portable digital recorder, she travelled to isolated places visiting rural communities. She recorded both groups and individuals singing songs and chants. From these people she discovered a world rich in musical diversity. In one place, which the locals referred to as the \"end of the line\" she encountered the Tremembe Indians and the Chief and his daughter decided to sing some of their traditional songs which Emily recorded and the Tremembe songs form the base for her tracks \"Rainmaker\", \"Agua de Menina\" and \"Prayer for the Fishermen\".\n\nReflecting the mythical traditions of Brazil her lyrics on the second track \"Candle in the Sand\" are about Yemaja (Goddess of the Sea) festivities: \"We sat and watched, The Sea drew the line ,Cool waters, memories in time. The shifting sands, like an hour glass, How quickly this time has passed. We tossed a flower in to the sea We lit a candle in the sand, The flame that burned, still speaks to me, Brings memories of that land.\"\n\n\"Day of the Dead\" features the Brazilian instrument the Birimbal which Emily has skilfully and uniquely set with the 'cello, she has also integrated location recordings of a procession of people made on the Day of the Dead. Manasses the acclaimed Brazilian guitarist from the North East of Brazil plays 12 string guitar.\n\n\"Realised Dream\" is another song of significance as it commences with a child's plaintive voice singing in Portuguese. Emily made this recording when she was giving workshops at a music school for children who work in the sugar cane plantations.\n\nEmily has created a production which has a ambient/world music resonance. The music is extraordinarily calming perhaps due to the way Emily multi tracks the 'cello and uses the instrument in a unique way to accompany her vocal lines.\n\nReviews:\n\"It's the cello though that ties everything together and makes this whole album impossible to ignore... Still, if you need to escape into music that is deep, thoughtful and also lifts your spirits then look no further than Emily Burridge\".\nEuropean Progressive Rock Reviews.\n\n\"In her compositions, Emily is capable of gathering, in a truly spontaneous way, elements derived from her Classical upbringing, together with those coming from the ethnic people she has lived with.\"\nAmazings.com.\n",

    "name": "Out of the Blue and Into the Amazon",
    "description": "Out of the Blue - By adopting modern looping and sampling technology I really love creating multi-tracked compositions which can enable me to utilise the palette of sounds and tonalities that the cello has to offer. The bow becomes like a paint brush and the different layers within a track make up the different shades of the picture that the title of the individual composition depicts.\n\nThis series of pieces begins with \"Salutation\" - a greeting. Sometimes in performance I describe the bass note as being like a river, broad and wide, like the Amazon river, and the salutation is to the people that live on it's margins. Images and the pace of a journey ensue with \"Out of the Blue\". In the context of a river the track can be likened to the eddies and current of the water. \"Reverie\" is a dreamlike piece, a reflection, a past love. In \"Globalisation\" I associate the different layers within the composition with both the positive and negative aspects of the current globalisation of the world. I wrote \"A Call to Peace\" having watched various films shot in Afghanistan. It is an appeal to all those involved with the decision for the act of war. In writing the music I was inspired by recollections of the sound of the Muslim Adhan \"call to prayer\". \"Andiamo\" means \"let's get going\". This is a sensual and joyful piece of music and I think of South American dancers when I am playing.\n\nInto the Amazon\nOver the last fourteen years the Mato Grosso of Brazil has been a frequent destination for me. Various tribal groups live in this region including the Xavante tribe with whom I have lived and worked. My involvement with this tribal group developed from a chance meeting when I was performing in events connected with the Earth summit in 1992 and in response to my concert the Xavante invited me to visit their village. They informed me that singing is integral to their daily cultural activities and that I must come and hear them sing. Two years later when I was living in Rio de Janeiro I followed up this invitation and travelled by bus for two days and eventually arrived on the edge of their reservation. I was guest in a traditional Xavante dwelling with a Chief and his family and entered into their world. They invited me to record their singing and the lyrics for the songs come from their dream time. Singing together is a unifying element for this tribal group. In this production I have selected some of these recordings which inspired me to compose \"Into the Amazon\".\n\nHere is a breakdown of each song:\n  * The production commences with \"Dawn\" and I accompany the birdsong.\n  * \"Morning Song\" is a group singing at the beginning of the day.\n  * \"Rain man sings\" is a recording of the Chief singing as he celebrated a rain storm.\n  * \"Agosta's Anthem\" is sung by the Chief's daughter. She asked me to record her early one morning when we were washing by the river. It is a song known by many Indians, a kind of anthem and is about their observation of the demise of the local habitat. In the song they warn of the consequent dangers and advise \"not to mess with the trees and the nature\".\n  * \"Adolescents\" is a recording of adolescent boys. They sing in groups tutored by an elder during a period before manhood when they live in seclusion from the daily life in the village.\n  * \"Proclamation\" is a recording of the whole village singing which occurs at the end of each day.\n  * Finally \"Atsawidi Maria\" - Atsawidi is a Xavante word used in greeting, in sending good wishes and here is a greeting to Maria - adopted from the Roman Catholics into their own religion. At the end of the day these prayers are said after their singing. The sun has set and night sounds of the forest fill the air.\n",

Blending and focusing the two styles deftly, Endless Blue creates organic soundscapes that slowly build to a powerful guitar driven crescendos, only to drop down into a bare whispered lyric. Hillman has honed her vocal style in Fever Dreams. From the breathy sadness of \"Her\" to the jazzy scat of the title track, her voice can not be easily described as \"sounds like X\". Added into the mix is Mitchell's newfound appreciation for hip-hop production, which shines with immediate driving beats and rumbling syncopated bass lines.\n\nFounded in 2003 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Endless Blue grew out of the remnants of Madison, Wisconsin electro-rock band STATE4. Desiring to do something a bit mellower and a bit more in the downtempo/trip-hop genre, Endless Blue released the first album in the spring of 2004, supporting it with a short US tour and regional shows around the Midwest. The band relocated to Milwaukee in early 2005 and continued to play local shows for the second album, \"Smoke Through It\".\n\nAfter just over three years since their last album, Milwaukee trip- hop duo \"Endless Blue\" have broken the silence and released a third album, Fever Dreams. Employing a large cast of guest musicians, core members Laura Hillman and Nick Mitchell went about crafting this new release meticulously and patiently, writing and rewriting many of the album's ten songs multiple times.\n\n",

Tying it all together are the vocal stylings of Laura Hillman, an artist that seamlessly blends numerous eras of vocalists into a single voice. Drawing from the torch singers of the '40s, the classic female rockers, and the modern trip-hop singers, Hillman weaves a masterful tapestry that complements each song uniquely.\n",

    "name": "The Laughing Cavalier",
    "description": "Few generations of artists have sensed the transience of life more keenly than the so-called 'Cavalier' poets and musicians of mid-17th century England. Perhaps this sensibility grew out of renaissance humanism's fascination with all aspects of human life - think of Shakespeare's 'Seven Ages of Man' speech - but perhaps too, some prompting of the Zeitgeist whispered to the cavaliers that their gay and glittering worlds of silks, satins and masques was on the brink of violent destruction in the Civil Wars.\n\nAt all events it seems fitting to try to tell the life story of imagined cavalier in one brief hour of music. After an opening 'carpe diem' song (track 1) and an invocation to the lute (track 2), we perform songs about youth and innocence (tracks 3 and 4), and songs about passionate young love in its many aspects (tracks 5 to 11). Next we consider the pleasures of middle age, with songs about drink and jollity (tracks 13 to 16) - and the midlife crisis, with a seduction song for an old man (track 17) and a song of mountebank cosmetics salesman, promising to turn back the years (track 18). Personal crisis is mirrored in the national crisis of civil war, with a lament for 'Jerusalem' (that is, England!) (track 19), a song of man to his imprisoned girlfriend (track 20) and a Royalist song looking forward to the King's return (track 21).\n\nIn old age our cavalier turns to contemplation, of the power of music and poetry to give solace (track 23) and of his religious faith (track 24); finally death comes, considered as sleep (track 25), as magical transformation (track 26) and as the end of music itself (track 27). But we couldn't leave you on this bleak note, so we close with a perky moral (track 27) - life is grim, but we can still go fishing...\n\nMuch of the music here has never been recorded before, mostly because it has never been published; and where it has been, it has usually been in solo song versions, not the rather richer and livelier vocal trios performed here. For musicians who would like to perform this music for themselves, an edition including 15 of the songs here will shortly be available from the Lute Society, at www.lutesociety.org.\n",

    "description": "I sing of a maiden that matchless is, but what maiden? A rosy-cheeked milkmaid treading the dawn dew as she goes out to milk her cows? A fine lady sighing at the window of castle tower? Or Our Lady, Queen of Heaven, Mother of God and Star of the Sea? It has been said that in mediaeval poetry you often cannot tell whether the poet is talking about his mistress or the Virgin Mary, and indeed that is neatly borne out in the lyrics of tracks 3 and 4 here, which use exactly the same imagery of a knight swearing fealty to his liege-lord - ?I am thy man, hand and foot, day and night? - to express devotion to Mary, and to a lover, respectively.\n\nErotic love and spiritual love sat easily together in the mediaeval mind in a way that they have not done since. Conventional history would explain that the language of mediaeval courtly love suited devotional poetry because courtly love was love from afar, never to be attained or consummated, having its origins in the feelings of young squires for the castle chatelaine whose lord was away fighting the crusades, perhaps. Later, a wedge was driven between romance and religion, firstly by the Protestant reformation of the 16th century, which sharply demoted the female principle in Christianity, banishing the mystical, magical, sensual, ritual, decorative and emotional aspects of faith; and secondly by scientific rationalism.\n\nToday of course, Darwinism and neurochemistry tell us, rather unsentimentally, that romantic love is associated with the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, and is part of a strategy evolved to ensure strong pair-bonding between the parents of the vulnerable human infant, while religious experience may be related to the hormone dimethyltriptamine, and the stimulation of the right temporal lobe of the brain.Yet for all that, could it be that the mediaevals, rather than being merely foolish and unreflective, were simply rather more honest than we are, in acknowledging the overlap between different types of love and beauty, sacred and secular, which in our modern prudery we feel embarrassed about? Many a new mother must have been surprised to discover that the strongest and purest love of all, of a mother for her child, can feel like a romantic, even erotic attachment.\n\nThis album then, celebrates a melting away of customary boundaries, a glorious mediaeval mixture and muddle, if muddle it be, between the sacred and the profane, the worldly and the spiritual, as expressed in 700 years of English music. Here are religious songs which were really popular ballads, probably never sung in any church [tracks 1, 3, 20] or which present spirituality in terms either of romantic love [tracks 9, 11] or of loving human relationships [tracks 3, 5, 10]. Alongside these we have put songs which, conversely, present romantic love in spiritual terms, in the language of faithful vow and pilgrimage [tracks 4, 13, 14, 16, 17] or which stand in the courtly love tradition of devotion to an unattainably high object [tracks 4, 8, 19]. As so often in English music, the imagery of nature is a thread running through all, even in religious music, where we would not particularly expect it [tracks 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19]. So we have included three songs which simply celebrate nature and the English village scene; a mediaeval song in praise of ivy [6], a song describing a morris dancing contest [19], and a classic English folksong of young love in a rural setting [15]. As befits our theme, we have not kept to a strict historical order, and the mediaeval lyrics are (in the case of the Holst settings) rendered into modern English or (in the case of the original mediaeval settings) tweaked here and there so that the listener should catch as much as possible without too much recourse to the lyric sheet.\n",

    "name": "Francesco Barsanti Sonatas for Recorder and Basso Continuo",
    "description": "Francesco Barsanti was one of many Italian musicians who ventured to the cold northern European climes in the early 1700s. He arrived on London's lively musical scene in 1714, together with Francesco Geminiani, fourteen years after Corelli's orchestra had, according to historian Roger North, \"cleared the ground of all sorts of musicke whatsoever.\" Geminiani, Barsanti and their contemporaries brought with them the sizzling Italian playing manner that soon became so popular. Barsanti made a decent living as flutist and oboist in the orchestra of London's Italian Opera Theatre. During these years, the six recorder sonatas were written, to be published in 1724 by Walsh on Catherine Street.\n\nThe recorder during this era was called simply \"flute\", or flauto, not to be confused with the \"flauto traverso\", or German flute. Barsanti's sonatas were published at a time when the transverse flute was beginning to overtake the recorder in popularity, but they are intended for the recorder. They are important not only because they are original compositions for the instrument, as opposed to transcriptions or arrangements, but also in that they represent some of the last works for the recorder before the instrument essentially went into hibernation for 175 years.\n\nBarsanti's compositional style is flamboyantly expressive, often eccentric, and full of passion and wit. Clearly he was familiar with Handel's works, yet his harmonic language, frequent use of 9-8 suspensions, and enharmonic cadential clashes are unique and daring; his use of slurs in both the melodic line and the bass line are innovative and at times downright quirky. The energy and spirit of Barsanti's fast movements coupled with his ardent emotive slower movements create masterful pieces of lasting quality. We hope you enjoy listening to these sonatas as much as we enjoy playing them!\n",

    "description": "Influenza Italiana, or the influence of the Italian style, is the unifying theme of this marvelous collection of baroque works presented by Ensemble Mirable in their latest recording.\n\nThe composers represented on this recording are all either Italians who helped develop the unique Italian style of baroque composition, or other Europeans who were influenced by the Italian style; incorporating Italian elements such as the agitated style of Monteverdi or the virtuosic instrumental styles developed by such composers as Marini and Castello. Among those represented here are Becker, Buxtehude, Uccellini, Ortiz, Buonamente, and Falconieri.\n\nWith this latest recording Mirable continues to present lesser known baroque works performed by some of today's finest artists using period instruments. Their lyrical and virtuosic performances breathe new life into these oft forgotten masterworks, reminding us of the glorious music that arose amidst the backdrop of severe hardship frequently experienced by composers of this time period, many of whom were affected by the black death that wreaked havoc in Europe from the 1340s through the 1770s. This recording reminds us both that the Italian influence extended far beyond the borders of what is now Italy, and that life in the 17th century brought with it inconceivable hardships yet managed to produce some of the finest music ever written.\n",

    "name": "Triemer Six Cello Sonatas",
    "description": "The Composer\n\nVirtuoso cellist and composer Jean Zewalt Triemer was born in Weimar around the turn of the eighteenth century, at a time when the cello had been steadily gaining popularity as both an orchestral and solo instrument. Around 1680, Viennese orchestras were utilizing this bass instrument and by 1720 it had spread into northern Germany. At the same time Johann Sebastian Bach had written his solo cello suites between 1717 and 1724, Triemer was becoming prominent as a cello soloist in Weimar where he studied with Gregor Christoph Eylenstein, cellist and chamber musician to the Duke of Weimar. Triemer's education in both performance and theory was sponsored by the Duke and he eventually became a member of the court orchestra. Considered one of the first virtuoso cellists in Germany, Triemer was added to Gerber's Dictionary of Music for his noteworthy performance accomplishments. From Weimar, he began his extensive travel, first taking him on a concert tour to Hamburg in 1725 where he was a member of the theater orchestra. After two years in Hamburg, Triemer left for Paris where he pursued the study of composition with Boismortier. His travels later took him to Amsterdam where he composed his set of six cello sonatas in 1745 as well as a cello method which was published in 1739. Triemer spent the rest of his years in Amsterdam, where he died in 1762.\n\nHis Music\n\nThe VI Sonatas for Violoncello are indicative of the increasingly challenging technique seen in the writings of other composers for the cello in the mid eighteenth century. This is seen in the extensive use of string crossings, chords, barriolage (as in Sonata III, second movement) and quick left-hand passage work. Also challenging is working with the thin texture created by the close proximity of the solo and continuo voices, being careful not to interrupt the cello line while at the same time providing support and creativity. Perhaps Triemer conceived the cello line first and subsequently added the continuo line, resulting in this challenging texture?\n\nThe spirited (and sometimes raucous) allegro movements, graceful minuets and poignant lento movements take both the performer and listener through a myriad of rhythmic figuration, colors, textures and resulting affects. Triemer's slow movement melodies have both charming and passionate vocal qualities, whereas the fast movements are often reminiscent of folk dance accompaniment, complete with fiddlers and bagpipes. Unlike these playful allegro movements, the final sonata (Sonata VI) ends with a fugue which unites the two individual lines yet creates a dialogue between them.\n",

    "name": "Chopin Preludes for Piano",
    "description": "Frederic Chopin (1810-1849) wrote most of his 24 Preludes in 1839 while on the island of Mallorca trying to recover from the poor health that plagued him during most of his short life. He was there with his companion, the writer George Sand, and her two children, taking a break from their life in Paris. This was considered his most prolific period, in spite of the unusual, bitterly cold weather they experienced during their stay on the island. The Preludes, 24 short compositions in all the major and minor keys, inspired by Bach's Well-Tempered Klavier, were met with mixed reviews from critics of Chopin's time, but Liszt wrote: \"they are poetic preludes, analogous to those of a great contemporary poet, who cradles the soul in golden dreams, and elevates it to the regions of the ideal.\" (1841). Many of the Preludes are less than a minute in length, though a few extend to several minutes.\n\nChopin began writing Polonaises as a young child in his native Poland. He was immediately recognized as a prodigy and compared favorably with the master Polonaise composer, Oginski. After leaving Poland at the age of 20, he spent the rest of his life in Paris, but he remained fiercely patriotic and was especially moved by the tragedy of the failed Polish uprising of 1830. The raw and powerful Polonaise in F# Minor, op. 44, was composed in 1841. It is a wonderful example of Chopin's ability to take a simple patriotic dance-form and bring to it an extraordinary originality and expressive force. One special feature of this Polonaise is Chopin's use of a gentle mazurka (another Polish dance) as a middle section.\n\nThe Barcarolle in F# Major, opus 60 was composed in 1845-46. A Barcarolle is a Venetian gondola song. Of Chopin's Barcarolle, Ravel said: \"Through his brilliant passages one perceives profound, enchanting harmonies. Always there is the hidden meaning which is translated into poetry of intense despair....The Barcarolle is the synthesis of the expressive and sumptuous art of this great Slav.\"\n\nMost of Chopin's mature music was composed on a French fortepiano by Pleyel, but Chopin was also partial to Graf style Viennese pianos he had performed on in 1830 when he made his very successful debut in Vienna. On this recording Eric Zivian plays an original Graf style fortepiano by Anton Rausch, built in Vienna in 1841.\n\nRecorded by John Buckman for ToneGnome Piano Recordings\n",

    "description": "German Sonatas for Viola da Gamba from the Baroque period.\n\nOn this album you will find some very fine sonatas and a suite from German composers who have been living between 1659 and 1787.\n\nThe viola da gamba came somewhat late in Germany. In 1571 a merchant bought a \"chest of viols\" made in London for the court in Munich. The viol was used in consorts and vocal ensembles, often played by English violists, like John Cooper. Then came the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) resulting in a decrease of cultural life.\n\nFrom Northern Germany, with the rich Hanseatic cities, there developed an important school of viol music. Composers like Buxtehude, Matthias Weckmann and Franz Tunder composed music for the instrument. Builders like Tielke made abundantly ornamented instruments. The nobility discovered the viola da gamba. Frierich Wilhelm von Brandenburg, Max Emanuel von Bayern, Leopold von Anhalt-Kothen and Friedrich Wilhelm von Preussen, played the instrument.\n\nJohann Friedrich Ruhe was Kapellmeister at Magdeburg Cathedral for 43 years, all of Ruhe's compositions are lost except for these five gamba works. Probably written in the 1730s, they are lively, forward-looking pieces in three and four movements in an Italianate Style with some resemblance of Telemann's style.\n\nTheodor Schwartzkopff 's career is closely related to the court of Wurttemberg where he worked as Kapellmeister. This suite is part of the music collection of the Crown Prince Friedrich Ludwig von Wurttemberg. Although the French style, played an important role in Germany, also this work bears strong Italian influences, but perhaps the suite form is more French then Italian.\n\nJohann Daniel Hardt worked in Strasbourg. He has been Kammermusikus for about five years to Stanislaus I and later he became violist for the Chapel of Bishop Johann Philipp Franz von Schonborn in Wurzburg. From 1746 on he was second Kapellmeister together with Ignaz Holzbauer und Niccolo Jomelli. In 1755 he retired.\n\nAnonymus from the Wiesentheid collection. Rudolf Franz Erwein had begun to form his musical collection, which still exists today at Wiesentheid. The beginnings of the collection date from 1694. Rudolf Franz Erwein played the flute and the bassoon, but his favorite instrument was the cello. The collection today contains around one hundred and fifty printed works and five hundred manuscripts, many of them, like this anonymous sonata, unique.\n\nCarl Friedrich Abel Abel was born in Kothen, where his father was a viol player in the court orchestra where Bach was Kapellmeister. When Bach moved to Leipzig, Abel 's father became this position. The young Abel studied at the Thomaschule, where he was taught by Bach. After 1759 he went to England and became chamber-musician to Queen Charlotte. He gave a concert of his own compositions in London together with his by then good friend Johann Christian Bach, the eleventh son of J.S. Bach. They organized England's first subscription concerts. Abel also composed orchestral works.\n\nJohann Christian Bach, was the youngest son of Bach who was already 50 at the time of his birth. From 1756 on, he lived for many years in Italy (Bologna and Milan). In 1762, Bach went to London and established a reputation in England. Like Abel he became music master to Queen Charlotte. The sonata on this CD was put up for auction in 1992 at Sotheby's in London and till then unknown. It is originally composed for the viol with pianoforte and just recently published by edition.

No matter how Scandinavian, there's always room for surprises and groovy improvisation.\n",

    "description": "\"Etherine is the name of a musical project by Michael Weeks, and \"24 Days\" is the first album created under the project's umbrella. The album was created as an experiment, the author wrote and recorded one song every day over a 24 days period. Despite the experimental character, it has cohesion and the inner \"movement\" of the album as you progress through the songs feels good and natural. The name of the project could not have been chosen more properly - Etherine creates a music that's ethereal, pure and transparent. And there's something to it that puts it light years ahead of the typical, forced-ethereal, ambient or \"new age\" music.\n\nThe usual \"new age\" products are sort of bland, just streams of peaceful sounds that are beautiful at times, but lack real meaning. While Etherine produces something that has character, and the message is clear for anyone who's open to it. The atmosphere is strongly introspective, and it clearly carries the marks of a genuine introspection - there's _someone_ behind that music, you can feel a soul's stirrings and ups and downs. But perhaps the album's biggest value resides in the \"altitude\" of the states of mind that are behind it. While some songs are a bit melancholic, and a very few are turned towards more earthly feelings, the pinnacles of the album are very, very high above.\nFlorin Andrei\n",

    "description": "From the dazzling liquid guitar loops of \"Mercurial Girl\" to the analog synth telegram embedded in \"What Planet Are We On?,\" Five Star Fall tricks out its sparkling pop with lots of satisfying sonic detail. This band really layers and lathers up the sound with old effects pedals, Kraftwerk-era drum machines, and hall-of-mirrors samples that work well with their upbeat, almost retro sense of wonder. Gordon Deppe's voice is as buoyant as ever, as is his kaleidoscope guitar work. The tracks are tight, polished, and impeccably arranged. Plus, Tom Lewis somehow coaxes synth-like groans from an old Fender bass while Michael Shotton delivers fast, intricate rhythms in the way that only a drummer with real heavy metal experience could. Melodic and meteoric, the well-crafted songs of Five Star Fall seem always to be rocketing forward toward some better tomorrow.\n",

    "description": "The Magnatune release of Chronic Dreams is a showcase for its do it yourself (DIY) pop musicians and casts these artists in what has been called an album of \"groove soaked ambient chill.\"\n\nLisa DeBenedictis is a singer/songwriter who has had great success at Magnatune with her ethereal, shimmering textural pop. A prototypical DIY musician she wrote and performed her entire debut solo album Fruitless. For Chronic Dreams Lisa re-recorded the vocals for \"Brilliant Day\" remixed here as a late-night ambient Al Green style in album's opener and later over a classical string quartet. She also sings a previously unreleased original song \"Ocean in her Head\" which makes it's world debut on Chronic.\n\nAnother DIY musician c. layne's music is pure, both in it's deceptive simplicity and depth of soul. On his Magnatune debut Potemkin Villages there are strong reverberations of 60's pop brought up to date in a distinctively modern style. Layne contributed the vocals to two previously unreleased songs to Chronic which were subsequently remixed here as a 10cc-style ambient (\"Just My Luck\") and the stunning album closer \"How Soon We Forget (Minsk Mix)\" which fuses layne's haunting vocals with the soaring, soul searing voices of the Kyiv Chamber Choir.\n\nIan Varley's band Drop Trio plays a unique blend of organ/electric piano jazz, fusion, rock. Their success, both artistic and commercial, is significant. Their brilliant album Big Dipper is a consistent best seller at Magnatune and their live performances are legendary for their energy and musicianship. The Trio's track \"Lefty's Alone\" was heavily sampled in Chronic Dream's \"Not Even Alone\" and Ian's brilliant electric piano playing can be heard on \"Be Brave (Dip Blotter Mix)\" which he specifically preformed for Chronic.\n\nThe prolific singer/songwriter Norine Braun is an indy iconoclast and her five (!) albums are all available on Magnatune. Her studio work is varied and deep and she proves a mastery over a multitude of genres. Norine's song \"Be Brave\" has been completely recast from it's original acoustic version on her latest release Now and Zen and appears on Chronic Dreams as \"Be Brave (Dip Blotter Mix)\" in a beat-era cool groove replete with jazzy-strings chorus.\n\nProducer Victor Stone (a.k.a. fourstones.net, Four Stones, fourstones) has been producing and collaborating online for 10 years. His first Magnatune release was a 40 minute mega-mix entitled Ridin' the Faders: Magantune Remixed. He currently runs the popular Virtual Turntable site aimed at helping DIY independent musicians with technical issues relating to recording their own music. Stone is also an outspoken advocate for music industry reform and is a regular contributor to the Creative Commons weblog.\n\nThe Chronic Dreams project was originally based Stone's concept of showcasing both the new business model at Magnatune as well as its artists. A deep background write-up on the genesis of Chronic can be found here. He also contributed several original instrumental and remix tracks including \"Dead Money\" and \"Art vs. Process.\"\n\nThe Chronic Dreams album is sprinkled liberally with samples from throughout the Magnatune catalogue including tracks by Indian artist touchingGrace, IDM techo by Beat Under Control, the Johannesburg Philharmonic, 30's style blues guitarist Jag and many, many others.\n",

    "description": "De Visee was the perfect incarnation of the complete, wholly fulfilled, long-lived and acclaimed musician of his times: guitarist, theorbist, lutenist, violist, cantore and composer. We do not have certain information concerning his birth and musical education, but all of the historical sources note that he was active in the Parisian area.\n\nBorn sometime between 1650 and 1660, he most probably studied guitar with Francesco Corbetta. Around 1680 he became a chamber musician in the service of Louis XIV, though with no formal title. In 1709 he obtained the post of singer of the royal chamber and only in 1719 he was officially recognised as having been the Roy-Soleil's guitar teacher, though he had in reality taught him the instrument since the death of Corbetta in 1681.\n\nHis theorbo music is contained in roughly forty manuscripts and in one printed volume. This recording includes pieces contained in the Besancon \"Vaudry de Saizenay\", Agen, Pn Res 1106 manuscripts.\n\nToday we appreciate the grandeur of the Roi-Soleil's era through its arts, literature and historical documents. Even before coming to know the music of this age we might imagine it was solemn, sustained and grandiose. On the contrary, the music that you will hear through Francesca Torelli's theorbo represents less the flamboyant side of court art and more its intimate aspect.\n\nDe Visee's relationship with the Roi-Soleil was rather private, and reached its daily culmination in a solo concert for the King's ears only. We can imagine the soave and 'insinuating' tone (as it was described by a renowned musician of the time) of the plucked stringed instrument as it lured the King into a mood of care-free relaxation.\n\nIn these compositions by de Visee the musical discourse is at times mainstream, reflecting the stylistic norms of the suite of that era, whilst at other times it reveals pure and innovative expressive liberty. The ornaments abound throughout, not as superfluous embellishments but rather as an integral part of the musical language, resulting in sinuous phrasing. De Visee follows the practice already established by French lutenists to compose non-metrical Preludes, meaning that they are not subdivided by bar-lines, allowing for freedom of interpretation. He takes this musical form to extremes by including strong dissonances and free 'flights' of musical fancy. Les Sylvains is a piece by Francois Couperin for harpsichord which de Visee transcribed for the theorbo. In turn Couperin bore witness to the reciprocal esteem of these two worthy musicians, active in the same years, by taking a gavotte by de Visee and adapting it for the harpsichord.\n\nEven though modern listeners might be immersed in the sonorities of pop and rock, I believe that they may fully grasp the sentiments and the atmosphere of de Visee's music, which is capable of transporting us far from daily life into a dimension of passionate intimacy.\n",

Within this tradition is a substantial corpus of music dedicated to Christmas celebrations of one sort and another; these songs also reflect the essentially bucolic nature of the communities who first developed and sang them.\n\nThe lyrics enumerate offerings to the Christ child which include bread, sausage, nuts, olives, sweetmeats and all kinds of rural produce; the celebrants offer to perform their local dances, dress in colourful costumes, bring their animals to join the worship, and so forth. Naturally, the theme of the shepherds at the Nativity features prominently, and of course the biblical travails of Joseph, Mary and their infant son must have struck a familiar chord in the minds of a peasant community. The rugged geography of the Iberian peninsula has also contributed to regional traditions being maintained well into modern limes.\n\nThe Spanish term villancico is most usually translated as \"carol\", though it does not carry the Christmas connotations of the English word. In Catalonia nadala or in Camille villancico de Navidad would be the usual definition. Many other forms of villancico can be defined, though that is more often the province of musicologists rather than the progenitors of the music. The essentially naive nature of the music and lyrics lends itself eminently well to performance on historical instruments - lutes, viols, recorders, early flutes, etc.\n\nThe work of 19th century collectors such as Rodriguez Marin, Inzenga, Pedrell and their contemporaries has been hugely expanded both by Spanish and foreign authors in more recent times, giving us a rich tapestry of folk music upon which to draw. Virtually all the songs on this disc survive as single melodies with a variety of lyrics, occasionally with a second harmonising voice. The task of preparing them for Galliarda's performance has thus involved harmonisation and the creation of quasi improvised instrumental ritornelli; with folk music there is no urtext in the conventional sense. Subsequently, the recordings are intended as entertaining arrangements, not an attempt at authentic reconstruction.\n\nIn addition to the folk elements, the disc contains a gallimaufry of other pieces to complement the Iberian theme, - essentially a distillation from one of Galliarda's concert programmes. Dentro en el vergel (anon) and O Reyes Magos (Juan del Encina) are found in the Cancionero de Palacio (c.1505-20), a source which includes a number of seasonal Christmas pieces in a more courtly vein of the folk tradition. Teresica hermana, set for the vihuela by Valderrabano (Book VI, 1547) is originally a villancico by the Catalan composer Mateo Flecha. Hespanoleta is from organ tablature in Flores de Musica (1706-09), while the evergreen Canarios dance by Gaspar Sanz (1674) found new life in the 20th century in a fantasia/concerto by Joaquin Rodrigo. The Gallardas by Santiago de Murcia is from his Passacalles y Obras de guitarra of 1732.\n\nFrom England we have plundered several sources which can supply a Spanish flavour to our proceedings: The Spanish pavan was widely popular in the 16th century and appears in a number of instrumental guises. Tobias Hume, the rumbustious advocate of the lyra viol who certainly encountered Spanish soldiers on his military adventures, gives us A Spanish Humour for ensemble and A Cavaleiro's Humour for bass viol. John and Henry Playford's \"Dancing Master\" (1651 et seq.) provides us with A New Spanish Entree ? Saraband. The haunting atmosphere of Noel nouvelet, is sung here in the French version. The melody is just as well-known with Spanish, Catalan and Provencal lyrics. Claude Daquin's Dixieme Noel might seem an interloper on this disc, but in fact it uses the same basic tune as Claro abril resplandecio, itself an air better known in Catalonia as El desembre congelat or La Nit de Nadal (Christmas Night). Finally, the Balls de bastons is our own medley of traditional Catalan dances such as one might hear even today accompanying sardanas on a mellow evening in Barcelona.\n",

He builds his elastic, funky grooves with a mixture of programming, composition and improvised jamming, the drum patterns usually being fattened with the rapid patter of Indian tabla. Thrown into the mix in various combinations is synth, guitar, bass, trumpet, Hammond, strings, various pianos and some sensual female ooh-ing and ah-ing. Cool Aberrations is sunny and tuneful throughout and, whatever the tempo, these soft-edged grooves remain swathed in the composer's trademark California glow.\" -Ambientmusicguide.com\n",

It received a grant from Socan (the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada). Here is what the critic of Socan wrote in their monthly magazine about Dry Fig Trees (named after a gorgeous painting by Armenian painter Vartan Tashdjian): \"The works featured on this album are clearly of a Middle Eastern flavour, notable for their modal scales and nostalgic mood. His nine 'Chansons sans paroles' are lovingly played by clarinetist Francois Houle with Gerard Satamian at the piano, while the composer is on his own in two excerpts from his Suite Lyrique. Warm, approachable and innocent music.\" Words ? Music\n\nFrancois Houle (Clarinetist on Dry Fig Trees)\nFrancois Houle's energetic performances are bridging the gap between the new music and improvisation. He went to McGill University in Montreal where he received his bachelor of music degree and graduated with a Masters degree from the Yale school of music. He also spent two years in residence at the Banff Centre for the arts. His great interest in contemporary music has led him to perform under the direction of Bruce Mather, Mauricio Kagel, Arthur Weisberg, Toru Takemitsa and Yannis Xenakis, among others.\n\nSince moving to Vancouver in 1990, Houle has established itself as a strong new voice on the Canadian creative music scene. Recent performances include all Western Canadian gas festivals, the Ottawa Jazz Festival, the Festival de Music Actuelle de Victoriaville, new music across America, time flies, and Seattle World Jazz Festival. He has also dedicated much of his time composing for his own critically acclaimed group Francois Houle Et Cetera.\n",

    "name": "The Missing Link",
    "description": "I have to explain a little bit about my work as a composer and musician. The \"missing link\" I'm talking about here is the viola da gamba, originally an improvisation instrument, which happens to be able to associate with all traditional instruments of the world.\n\nThere is the manifestation, then the writing of a composition (to communicate with other musicians), and most important of all, its interpretation. In both cases, for me, it is always a question of improvisation.\n\nOpen-minded music for Open-minded people.\n\nWhy \"World Music\"?\n\nIn the jungle of commercial-style classifications, as on MySpace or other internet portals there isn't any label (open-minded music) yet, I have to use the catch-all wording of \"World Music\". As my music \"blends\" influences from all over the world, so be it; whatever, I'll always be French. When I started playing music, and later the viola da gamba, I never wondered about musical style, which brought me some problems with various \"police\", the \"jazz police\", the \"baroque police\", the \"art producer police\" (\"this music is too good for that film\") ... are there also \"World music police\"?\n\nMeeting with older \"masters\" did help me a lot on my way. Martial Solal in 1979: \"You can do what you want but should be able to explain it\". Constantly unsatisfied, I never felt at ease in a style, and always went too far for my colleagues. Someday someone offered me a book by A.K. Coomaraswamy: \"The Transformation of Nature in Art\", in which he explains traditional art, and the idea that Style is the man, and by no means the essence of art.\n\nAnother \"master\", Dr. M. Bernhard, professor at the Music Institute of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (sounds good ay!),opened the doors of his library to me. So I studied European medieval music treaties and naturally Gregorian music. I discovered real treasures. References always go back to Plato. But as information here was relatively vague, I continued by searching in Arabic and Indian music.\n\nTraditional bases of music theory are almost the same everywhere on this planet. Learning through books, is fine, but I consider it not enough, and the theory must be experienced through actual traditional practice, when possible. So I experienced with mostly oriental musicians (Arab, Turkish, Indian), as the practice of modal improvisation is more than rare in the West.\n\nSo I have been able to revitalize all these modes, which have been known as \"church modes\" ever since good old Gregory.\n\nThe discovery of the viola da gamba in 1993 for a film score did change my music a lot. For about 15 years I stopped working with chords and did only melodies, but as I still liked ensemble music I composed pieces using parallel melodies, like in \"The City\". Meeting modern hurdy-gurdy player Valentin Clastrier has been crucial, as he advised me to use electronics with the viola da gamba. Here I found a link to my past with electric guitar, where I used all well-known effects like echo, reverb, wah-wah, flanger etc., plus the synthesizer and sampler worlds. In my career during some studio recordings, I happened to have to replay a bass line, then a keyboard and even percussion part, realizing at the end, apart from the vocals and possibly drums, I had played everything. Little Mike Oldfield from Nancy was born.\n\nI always use a special concept for a composition, as in film music. I have about 3 hours of compositions waiting for recording (Dragon, Tortue, Libellule, Papillon, Funambule...), the titles say it all.\n\nIn this recording I chose the most accessible compositions, leaving too complex rhythms (9, 6, 5, 11 and 13, in the relevant order), and used almost everything I had at my disposal (Ableton Live software), a lot of vocoder. As I don't have a midi viol, I \"had to\" put the sound of the viol through the filter of a synthesizer or sampler. And then even a wah-wah effect. \"Why not?\" said Frank.\n\nNot being subjected to time constraints as support for images, the compositions did not have to be formatted in an acceptable way for the masses; each musical idea implies its own development, and so the pieces are relatively long, sort of \"symphonic poems\".\n\nThe interpretation is another \"paire de manches\" (a whole different ball game). Find the musicians who can, who will, who dare, and who stay, most importantly of all modal improvisers. And keep it going. This recording reflects my ideal ensemble, and I hope to reproduce it live as soon as possible.\n",

In this creative process, all the musicians' contributions to my compositions have been essential in giving the music the shape it finally took.\n\n\"Daydreamin'\" is a collection of pieces which I have composed in the past 15 years. Some of them were originally created for my trio (like \"Riflessioni\"), others for a quintet that I had in Italy (\"Sagittarius\" for example), or for a special performance (\"Namibia\").\n\nAfter moving to Paris, France, I was looking for musicians who would share with me a special empathy. I was struck by Antoine and Nicolas, who were playing together at a jam session: their rhythmic drive was fantastic and their phrasing so subtle, always responding and strongly relating to the soloist's statement. Christophe is a very special musician, always developing his solos thematically, and through his creative process at all time closely listening to his fellow musicians. Ferruccio and I are very close friends and together we have created the group \"InventaRio\". I love his lyrical qualities as a bass player, although he can as well support the soloist with a sure drive, as shown in the live recording here included.\n\n\"I have known Giovanni for a few years now, and has always had the fire of creativity in his playing.

    "description": "Gonzalo Ruiz explains: three works on this disc were composed for cello and the fourth for flute. The baroque oboe is not an instrument normally heard in an unaccompanied setting. I don't believe Bach ever envisioned that these particular pieces would be performed on oboe, although I like to think that he would approve. The truth is that I play them simply because I love them and have lived with them for many years.\n\nWhen I first heard Bach's unaccompanied suites I practically had a crisis, fearing that I had picked the wrong instrument. My love for the oboe was shaken by the realization that there was nothing in its repertoire like these complete masterpieces for a single player, and suddenly my warmup routines seemed intolerably dry and boring next to those of cellists who started their day with a bracing round of Bach. It was years before I dared tackle an arrangement of one of them and then it was for strictly personal reasons. The suite became my main etude, my biggest challenge, and a constant companion that traveled everywhere in my instrument case. As the number of these arrangements grew, so did my abilities on the instrument. I found that working on them was the best way to prepare for the next concert, whatever repertoire it contained. I never thought I'd perform or record them, but over time I ceased to think of them as \"music written for other instruments\" and began to feel them simply as \"music I enjoy playing\".\n\nListeners familiar with these works will notice the ways in which I altered them to fit the oboe. These include the choice of key, some degree of octave transposition, and adapting or omitting many double stops, but in some cases they are simple esthetic choices. In measure 32 of the G minor Sarabande for instance, I suspect I am plausibly correcting a copyist's mistake in the surviving manuscript. In the repeat of measure 24 of the Sarabande of BWV1008 the F natural is not what Bach wrote but a beautiful alternative, and is dedicated to Anner Bylsma and Michael Marissen as my talisman against the risks involved in changing the text.\n",

    "description": "This album is the natural sound of the dilruba (an Indian instrument which is a cross of the sitar and sarangi) recorded in a temple without any processing. The only accompaniment is the occasional sounds of the morning birds. Many people listen to this music for relaxation, meditation, soft movement, healing sessions and it is also music that can be listened to while falling asleep.\n\nThis music was recorded in an old abandoned temple near the ocean in India. Gopal played this rare multi stringed bowed instrument in that temple at sunrise, without any intention of the music becoming a solo album. There was a beautiful empty silence in the temple and a feeling of letting go and disappearing into the music.\n\nThrough meditation, Gopal came to understand that the silent gaps between musical notes are significant: they can be a doorway to go beyond the busy mind. Music that gives space for silence can allow the listener to enter an inner, soundless place of peacefulness. This meditative quality of the dilruba is expressed in this album. The name dilruba means \" beloved of the heart\" and also \"the thief of the heart\". Gopal discovered that the dilruba has a wide range of \"colors\", from deep rich tones to higher sweet sounds, from playfulness to heartfelt emotions... music that can touch the heart and soul.\n",

    "description": "The dilruba is an old rare Indian Classical instrument with a meditative quality and a heartfelt sound that goes well with other instruments, creating a rich tapestry of sounds that touches the heart and relaxes the body-mind. This can be heard in \"Mystic Journey\", an album that features the dilruba combined with other instruments such as Indian bansuri (bamboo flute), santoor and zither. The album starts slowly with the dilruba and flute spontaneously responding to each other as if in an intimate heart to heart communion. The album ends even more slowly, taking the listener on a relaxing inner journey, step by step, deeper and deeper.\n\nIt has many resonating strings that vibrate in synchronicity with its bowed strings, giving a rich, reverberating and sweet sound. For some people the dilruba's tender yet powerful sounds seem to come from an ancient time, evoking a feeling of \"coming back home\".\n\nGopal's music is especially suited for soft movement, yoga, massage, healing, meditation, trance, relaxation and also for listening while falling asleep. His music has a natural inward quality, taking the listener from sounds to the soundless, from the busy market place to an inner silence that rests within everyone.\n",

Translucent is an amalgamation of traditional electronica styles, infused with new and exciting energy that pushes the edges of contemporary music, and grounds itself in the universal medium of Bass, Beats, and Beauty.\n\nThese are songs that mix the ancient salt of tide pools with the gleam of mercury; natural ambiences tastefully introduced and skillfully blended, pulsing and undulating rhythms fused with soothing strings and electronic textures awakening the body to movement while opening the mind to infinite possibilities.

She performs on a harpsichord based on the Ruckers-Goujon harpsichord in the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire in Neuchatel, Switzerland; it has more than a frisson of the original Ruckers, and tenders energy and complexity to the works of D'Anglebert, Couperin, Forqueray, Duphly ? Balbastre. The title of the album derives from Couperin's famous work \"Les Baricades Misterieuses\" which was published in 1717 in his VIth Ordre de Clavecin. Although countless theories have been advanced as to the meaning of the title, none is convincing, and the ineluctable modality of the piece has captured the imaginations of composers, writer and artists. In 1961, Rene Magritte painted \"Les Barricades Mysterieuses,\" which eventually was transformed into a grand mural in Halle Delvaux at the Palais des Congres in Brussels.\n\nThe French harpsichord school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is known as Les Clavecinistes. They flourished and achieved a refinement of keyboard writing which was constantly admired and often imitated outside their home country. The French Clavecinistes flourished at the royal court and the aristocratic salons of Paris. This recording will take you on a journey among the different generations and styles of French harpsichordists and composers.\n",

    "name": "Harpsichord suites of Chambonnieres",
    "description": "Jacques Champion de Chambonnieres (ca1601- ca1672) is considered the father of the French harpsichord School, a style of playing that reached its zenith in the works of Francois Couperin and Rameau. He was the first musician to hold the position of Harpsichordist of the King. To the pay of six hundred livres (pounds) he added, around 1650, a pension of one thousand ecus (crowns) drawn on the royal treasury, which is an indication of the esteem he then enjoyed. He published two books of works for solo harpsichord in 1670, and a number of other pieces survive in various manuscripts. In addition to his activities as a composer Chambonnieres was also an accomplished teacher. Among his pupils were many of the most important players and composers of the time: the three Couperin brothers, Hardel, one of the Gautiers, d'Anglebert, Lebegue, Cambert and Nivers.\n\nChambonnieres showed the desire, never realized, to seek his fortune at the court of Queen Christina of Sweden. To this end, Constantijn Huygens was enlisted to pave the way for him there. Meanwhile, his current position at the French court was jeopardized by a nearly successful plot to force Chambonnieres to resign in favor of his student Louis Couperin. The loyal refusal of Louis Couperin to displace Chambonnieres could only have sprung from high personal regard. In 1662 he finally found himself abruptly deprived of his pension. As a result he sold his post to his pupil d'Anglebert for 2000 pounds. Chambonnieres held his engagements, but the services were covered by d'Anglebert; Chambonnieres no longer appeared at court, in the concerts or the ballets.\n\nChambonnieres was famous early in his life. Mersenne described his playing as distinguished by delicacy and subtlety of touch, fleetness without display, and imaginative embellishment: \"each time he played a piece he mingled in new beauties ports de voix, passages and various ornaments, with doubles cadences\". A little later Mersenne praised him even more highly: \"After listening to the harpsichord played by the Sieur de Chambonnieres ! I can only express my feeling by saying that one should hear nothing afterwards, whether one desires lovely melodies and fine accompanying parts mingled together, beauty of rhythm, fine touch or lightness and speed of hand ! it can be said that this instrument has met its ultimate master.\"\n\nThe works of Chambonnieres have been preserved for us in two engraved volumes and in several manuscripts. The Bauyn Manuscript (ca1690) is considered one of the most important sources of French keyboard music of the seventeenth century. This single source brings together 350 pieces, most written for the harpsichord, and is organized into three sections, the first consecrated entirely to Chambonnieres, the second to Louis Couperin, and the third to various composers like Froberger, Hardel and du Mont. The pieces in the ms are grouped to mode, and within each modal grouping are further organized accordingly to dance forms. Some of the Doubles have been taken from a manuscript in the Bibliotheque du Conservatoire in Paris. These doubles are published in the complete Chambonnieres edition published by the Broude brothers (edited by P. Brunold and A. Tessier). I have adhered to the French customary grouping; allemande, courante, sarabande, gigue. Even though Chambonnieres is not known to have formally used the word \"Suite\" he does group his dances in this order. Optional pieces include the chaconne, pavane, gaillard, volte, brusque and menuet.\n\n(d minor Suite) Allemande La Loureuse - Courante* - Double de la Courante* - Sarabande* - Pavanne* - Sarabande* - Gigue la Madelainette\n(G major Suite) Pavane l'Entretien des Dieux - Courante - Double de la Courante** - Sarabande Jeunes Zephirs* - Double de la Sarabande Jeunes Zephirs** - Menuet -Chaconne* - Gigue*\nC major Suite Allemande Le Moutier* - Double Allemande Le Moutier by L. Couperin* - Courante Iris - Double de la Courante Iris by d'Anglebert** - Sarabande de la Reyne - Gigue La Verdinguette - Double de la Gigue La Verdinguette attributed to d'Anglebert**\n(g minor Suite) Allemande dite l'affligee* - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue\n(F major Suite) Allemande - Courante* - Sarabande O Beau Jardin attributed to d'Anglebert** - Double de la Sarabande O Beau Jardin attributed to d'Anglebert** - Chaconne* - Chaconne*\n\nAll pieces were taken from the engraved books except where noted:* Bauyn Manuscript** ms Reserve 18 223 Bibliotheque du Conservatoire Paris.\n\nA note on the recording:The harpsichord used in this recording was made by in 1996 in Amsterdam by Joop Klinkhamer after an instrument by Ruckers-Goujon (1632/1742) currently in the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire in Neuchatel, Switzerland. In its present state, the original is strung very lightly to preserve it; our instrument conforms more to 17th century stringing practices which makes it suitable for earlier harpsichord repertory since its tonal palette is both dark and transparent with clear articulation. 2x8' 1x4' FF-ff''' A=392.\n\nEvery technical effort was made in this recording. Producer David Bowles and engineer David Tayler tried to recreate the feeling of sitting in front of the instrument as it was being played, with the image hovering slightly higher than the speakers. In addition, we felt it was necessary to have an absolutely transparent texture, in which the inner voices of the music can be clearly heard without any metallic ring to the overtones. Two matched pairs of Schoeps microphones were used in conjunction with a Mytek 8X96 AD converter in four tracks at 88. 2 kHz/24 bit. A high speed preamp was used to capture the transients in the sound and provide superior imaging, and the tracks were combined and edited using the Sadie system. The imaging is so sharp that you can hear the bass notes coming from the right side of the harpsichord, just as in a live acoustic!\n\nRecording Production, Digital editing and Mastering: David v. R. Bowles\nEngineering: David Tayler and David v. R. Bowles\nTuning: Andrew Lagerquist\nRecorded 1-4 October 2001 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Belvedere, CA\n",

This album, as part of a trilogy of live recordings from Chartres France, where Hans appears as adjunct faculty to Wisdom University's annual New Chartres Mystical School, is steeped in introspection, spiritual suspense, and sonic symmetry.\n\nHans employs a technique called live-looping which enables him to record himself on the fly and play to it, adding or subtracting multiple melodic layers. The music is an exquisite construction of a harmonic web which captures the listener with its gentle but probing quality. Subtle and passionate, understated and elegant, deliberate yet played with abandon, All Is Well will remind the listener of their own spiritual journey. A great album to chill out, do yoga, slow movement, or have a talk with God.\n",

This album also has some great sound design with tape effects, backwards phrasing, half speed loops and more. Finding new musical settings for the cello has always been of interest to Hans, and on this CD he has discovered some amazing new territory in this regard. Some pieces have an electronic quality with oscillator-driven drone scapes, while others incorporate a distinctly classical orchestral sound. Esoteric yet very warm. Enjoy!\n",

Recorded live in Chartres, France, July 5-10, 2010\n\nUndefended Heart is a courageous step towards vulnerability, a documentation of a journey towards a light that liberates us from ourselves, from the egoic selves, and opens an internal space that permits us to be who we really are. It is also a place of healing, where all internal tensions, lies, and deceptions recede and yield to a vision of the compassionate true nature of mankind. It opens a timeless listening experience, perfect for yoga, massage, movement, or just being quiet.\n\n\"Hans Christian's music is unique.

    "description": "Hans Christian, veteran cellist, music producer and member of the GuruGanesha Band, is offering a new album called Hidden Treasures. The music on this instrumental album spans a four year creative time period in which Hans would freely record musical ideas, often archiving them for future completion. The lyrical, orchestral blend of layered strings within a contemporary production reflect Hans' fluid musicality, ranging from gorgeous melodic structures to deeply felt emotional renderings on solo cello.\n\nThis unique sound was first shared with a wide audience through his work with his mystical world music group RASA (featuring singer Kim Waters). His appearance as a guest musician on countless albums in the greater devotional music genre has often added a highly virtuosic and emotional quality to those projects, and so it also happens on this album, there is something infectious about the strong sense of melodies on this album which weave, turn, and morph with a captivating beauty.\n\nSome pieces on Hidden Treasures are contemplative in nature, while others are rhythmically driven to reveal a darker and more muscular color. This musician is not afraid to express the frequencies of all chakras with an earthy foundation, imaginative soundscapes, and ethereal overtones in the upper frequency range.\n\nA deeply sonorous cello weaves a continuous lead throughout the album, and Hans Christian fans will not be disappointed with his heartbreakingly beautiful performances on Heart To Heart, Cathedral Of Tears (recorded inside Chartres Cathedral, France), and I Lift Up Mine Eyes.\n\nReview of Hidden Treasures\nWhile the harp may be the instrument of Heaven, the cello is the voice of the soul, especially when Hans Christian holds the bow. His mastery with \"live looping\" - accompanying himself with rhythm, melody, punctuation and majestic strings - and expertise with other exotic instruments (mohan veena (adapted sitar), the Swedish nyckelharpa, and the sarangi) creates mini-masterpieces that form an exquisite whole.\n\nHis appearance as a guest musician on countless CDs in the devotional music genre has added a virtuosic and emotional quality to those projects. There is something infectious about his strong sense of melody which flows with a captivating beauty. Some pieces on Hidden Treasures are contemplative in nature; others are rhythmically driven to reveal darker tones. Hans is not afraid to express the frequencies of all chakras with an earthy foundation, imaginative soundscapes, and ethereal overtones in the upper frequencies. Hans' deeply sonorous cello weaves magic throughout this album.\nLloyd Barde\n",

A mixture of classical, rock, and world music. Originally released in 1993, remastered in 2003, it is rich in ethnic, pop, and neo-classical ingredients, with the cello soaring through a colorful tapestry of rhythms and melodies. Passionate intensity is the driving force behind this stunningly beautiful and rich music. It clearly penetrates deeply into life and is unafraid to explore the full breadth of existence - including the shadow side, without which we would be unable to know the light. Cello is often the lead instrument, along with a full regalia of exotic instrumentation, including electric basses, electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards, sound effects, vocals, percussion, didjeridoo, tablas and frame drums.

The pieces on Surrender suggest a musical path that freely crosses the boundaries between Eastern and Western traditions in a fusion of cultural styles. where the classical/European voice of the cello, the Far Eastern or Middle Eastern sounds of an oud-like guitar, Balalaika or Shakuhachi are integrated with the modern pulse of electronic timbres. Each composition in this collection is decidedly different; passion dominates one piece, the next is reflective, another brings powerful rhythms - yet each is carried by a clear melodic voice which gives rise to a deep probing into the listener's soul.

    "description": "Further Adventures in Monkeyland - Exploring the archives of unreleased demos from his days in Monkeyland, Andy re-recorded some of his first songs, trying to keep the original sentiments as far as production goes. The album has a synergy and collectively illustrates Andy's love of shimmering guitars soaked in reverb and delay on top of lush strings and walls of overdriven guitar sound.\n\nSeed of Sin was originally laid down as a quick idea on a 4 track cassette. 15 years later it was finished and re-recorded and is probably more relevant now that Andy's obviously older with lyrics proclaiming \"I still feel this young\". A driving edgy guitar track full of apprehension.\n\nChase the Vagabonds explores the innocent sentiment of trying to hold onto a relationship by offering lots of promises. Chiming, shimmering echoey guitars mixed with big ambient vocals give this very melodic pop track an ethereal quality.\n\nRejuvenation cranks up the tempo and the guitar noise and talks hopefully about a brave new world. There's a few twists where the track virtually stops and then explodes again.\n\nFigure 8 is a very catchy love song with jangly guitars, shuffle beats and a very simple chord structure.\n\nThe Furthest Outpost is more ethereal and builds up with suspense, into a huge wall of guitar sound. Again the sound focuses on hope and optimism, albeit in an escapist way.\n\nAll the Way to the Pit is a strange acoustic based bouncy track with an odd minor chord structure. The vocals talk in a more negative way about a relationship gone sour.\n\nThe heaviest of the tracks is Don't Die on Me - funky sequenced beats and baseline underlays big crunching guitars and a driving chorus line talking about not giving up in a desperate situation.\n\nBig Mistake is one Andy's oldest songs - a simple descending chord structure, driven by acoustics and overlaid with ringing guitars, the song has a medium tempo and energy.\n\nVagrancy appeared on many Monkeyland recordings as a new wave punk style track, but this is the original feel which was more laid back and casual.\n\nEyesore, again appeared very differently to this on Monkeyland recordings with a funkier Madchester beat. This was the original flavour though - an ambient, gentle track with small bells and piano, talking about collateral damage in a war zone.\n\nThe Wooden Attraction is a short, fast paced indie guitar song, which was written simply about a wooden bench in Andy's hometown that was akin to a throne for the local idiot of the moment. Some great idiots have sat there and this song pays homage to them all.\n\nCloser Than completes the album and this is a mysterious ethereal track that builds and falls all the way through and speaks about the everlasting life.\n",

    "description": "After 4 albums, there were many tracks that weren't included as they didn't fit the respective album styles and so the best of these were brought together to form The Glue Factory, Heifervescent's fifth album.\n\nSuperglue opens the album and mixes heavy distorted guitars with analogue synths. Vocals talk about being overwhelmed by a lover and being out of control.\n\nMagnetized has a similar theme but the music is more raw and less synth driven.\n\nThe pace slows down on As far as the eye can see, a track full of psychedelia, random bursts of energy and subdued vocals.\n\nTripping Touring Taxi gets a little more country and blues with a slight twist here and there. Again the vocals have a slightly random and mixed up feel with lots of questions.\n\nLunar Module takes the listener through a very short relationship full of small talk, which ends prematurely. the innocence of the event is reflected in the simple chord structure and simple guitar sounds.\n\nLast Drop Loverboy steers in the opposite direction and approaches the subject of abuse and desperation. A roller coaster of a track, the majority of the mix is low key, with loud chorus bursts.\n\nThe mood makes way for manic chaos in I'm Not Moving Honey - full of crazy 60s organs and punk guitars and distorted vocal chants.\n\nWhat's this all about is more melancholy and melodic with a reminiscing vocal theme and soft overdriven guitars.\n\nMurder in the Garden (part 2) ends the album with a strange painful rumbling approach full of intrepidation and guitar noise\n",

    "description": "An upbeat, melodic, pop driven album.\n\nThe album starts with 'The Mind Laboratory' a uniquely styled funky pop track featuring wah-pedalled guitars and a quirky synthesizer riff. The sentiment of the song is about conditioning the mind to feel optimistic, despite an acceptance of growing older. A song about being thankful about what you have, and holding on to love and life.\n\n100 miles or more is quite the opposite of the preceding track - a song about self doubt and worry that you've overstepped the mark. Acoustics and overdriven guitars give this a pacey indie rock feel with slightly distressed vocals.\n\nShopping for religion asks the big questions about organised religion - why? how? what? It doesn't necessarily rebuke any particular religion, it just says 'don't shove it down my throat'. The music mixes a very catchy melodic chorus with psyched and 80s synth patterns.\n\nBilly Comes Home moves along on top of catchy repeating guitar progression, throwing in analogue synths and lush strings. Focusing on returning to a place you left many years before and finding everything changed - you're no longer part of a particular society, you're not in the cliques any more and frankly you start regretting going away in the first place. Jangly guitar arpeggios ring throughout with 60s style backing vocals.\n\nBomb is a short, quiet acoustic track about feeling like a ticking bomb running out of time, hoping that someone can defuse the situation.\n\nSharkbite is a lamentation - remembering a loved one who was taken away. Waltzing acoustics, strings and piano and flute underlay vocals which compare the death to a final sea journey.\n\nChased by a cow was sparked by an actual event where Andy was actually chased by a cow whilst trespassing across a farm field. However the incident also triggered a feeling of mindless giddiness and whilst running away sparked a further feeling of invincibility. The music is very upbeat, uplifting and optimistic, with jaunty electric guitars and strong happy pop melodies.\n\nIn contrast again, The Man from the County Court depicts a man in trouble, apologizing for dragging his lover down. A predominantly acoustic track which keeps you in suspense until the big crescendo at the end.\n\nRational Behaviour brings a punk/new wave indie feel back to the album with crunchy guitars and aggressive drums. However the track retains a simple catchy melody and talks about a friend who criticizes everything but doesn't really know what he/she's talking about.\n\nA Friend for Life is a song for when you're simply sick of the human race. Animals don't answer back or try and change your life and that is the focus of this song. Bouncy acoustics and electric guitars set the base for happy catchy vocal melodies.\n",

    "description": "Possibly the darkest of all of Heifervescent's albums, Murder in the Garden combines edgy guitars with big strings and orchestral sections to create some dark atmospheric alternative rock moments along with some shimmering pop.\n\nThe album starts quite upbeat with Bessie's secret, which probes behind the door of a seemingly sweet old lady who harbours a dark secret past. Crunching guitars over pacey acoustics.\n\nWonderful Thing ambles along at first with just rhythm guitar, bass and vocals until the chorus where everything joins the mix and the song paints a wonderful picture of the lover, given extra depth with the hammond organ and then horns and big symphonic strings.\n\nElectric Towers is essentially a melodic indie rock song, combining overdriven guitars with delicate piano parts and organs, the words illustrating the beginning of the end of a relationship.\n\nThey've got tanks and everything has a sense of urgency with reverb soaked synth loops and punk drums and bass. The lyrics paint a picture of being surrounded and fear and anticipation.\n\nWhere I once was brings the tempo right down with an atmospheric period of reflection, reminiscing about good times. The echoey guitars and harmonies add to the ambience.\n\nA disturbing look at the effects of war is brought to the table with Someone just took our babies. Ironically the song has quite a pleasant tempo and melody. The combination of pleasantries with the disturbing subject matter makes the song seem even darker.\n\nRespond take the atmosphere even darker beginning with menacing laughter and deals with a person who has had the life sucked out of them. Heavy rock guitars join the mix and the track goes up from level to level until the wall of guitar sound that is the chorus.\n\nThe Diplomat is noise fuelled crashing alternative rock song with repeating riffs and focusing on the subject of diplomacy and avoiding making a decision.\n\nJourney through the slugs keeps the heavy theme going but with the 60s style organ and upbeat melody, the track is actually a bizarre love song.\n\nMurder in the Garden is a deep schizophrenic love song where the girl is told, by her lover, that her lover is dead, as if he is another person. The words are sincere and heartfelt and erupt into a powerful chorus where the lover admits he had problems. The song is a roller coaster of delicate intricate acoustic guitars and crashing distorted guitars.\n",

    "description": "The \"most listened to\" of all the Heifervescent albums, Pondlife Fiasco is a melodic twisting journey through indie guitar psychedelia.\n\nThe opening track When the Stars Fall from Grace begins with chiming acoustic and electric guitars and describes a fateful love affair where nothing seems enough for the lover. Strings, backing harmonies and flutes give the track a gentle ambience, but the chords have a sense of urgency.\n\nDeep Sea Diver is probably the most well known Heifervescent track, and was at one stage, for a short time, one of the most listened to Creative Commons tracks in the world. A hard chugging baseline joins stabbing guitars as the distorted vocals sing about a couple locking themselves into a shelter to sit through the impending chaos.\n\nKaleidoscope begins slowly and gently with just vocals, electric piano and flutes. The vocals explain the reserved beauty of a lover and plans to make everything ok. The chorus is joined by tremelo guitars and strings with a pleasant low key melody.\n\nWe've got to plug you in speaks to a vacant lifeless person who simply needs a kick up the ass to get on with their lives. The minor key and distorted vocals, gives the track a slightly distressed feel.\n\nStop Following Me could be relevant to anyone who's being followed, hounded, stalked by sinister people but it was actually just a song about a wasp. A slow paced ballad with piano and full orchestral parts.\n\nIt's Coming Together is a more light hearted love song with melancholy piano riffs and bells. The chorus is full of optimism and pop naivety.\n\nOut of Tune brings the mood down again - a slow waltzing number with the pain of failure and self loathing. The song goes from quiet reflection to crashing guitar solos and back again.\n\nCounting without Numbers is possibly the poppiest track on the album with a catchy guitar melody, and approaches the subject of sheer confusion, when you're in a situation that just defies logic? like counting without numbers.\n\nVictim of Crime is a big slow lamenting song asking all the questions after a lover has left. Big strings and woodwinds give the track some classic moments, but the crashing guitars and backing vocals keep the track edgy.\n\nThe final track - And the Pond Life Flourished is made of a big repeating guitar riff and vocals that try and justify the loss of the lover by playing the memories down and remembering all the pain. The song plods along slowly and aggressively but maintains a catchy chorus and vocal layers.\n",

    "description": "Verbal Bandit has a slightly more folky feel in parts than the other Heifervescent albums. Songs are about real life and the strange situations that you find yourself in set to very melodic indie pop tunes, with an abundance of guitars - acoustic and electric.\n\nGolden Gun is the opening track - a 60s style rhythm with a slight country lead guitar, the song tells tales of the paranoid thoughts of closet hypochondriac. Strings and vocal harmonies give the song depth and charm.\n\nWishbone has more of big ambient chorus with swirling strings and harmonies, but quickly dips into mysterious verses and lyrics that contrast the feeling of optimism and hope with all the negative things that are occurring.\n\nNorthern Casanova tells the tale of a hapless love affair. Although everything goes wrong, the song speaks to the ex-lover about the side they never saw. Acoustics, harps,strings and french horns bring the story to life.\n\nRun while you've still got your legs describes being at the end of your tether, in a no win situation, where it's ok to take the easy way out through the back door. A sweeping ballad with big symphonic strings and gentle acoustics.\n\nStrange kind of fiction tells the twisted story of couple who think their sex life is over. So the man phones a sex chatline and recognises the female voice as his wife. A country/folk style track with a twist.\n\nFabricated Loony Commune describes a scary big brother world where nothing is private, everybody knows everything about everybody. The songs retains its pop melody but the track has quite an eerie ominous feel.\n\nThe Suspect List once again deals with the subject of paranoia, but this time, it's deeply paranoid man that thinks everybody wants to kill him. An indie guitar style fused with a slight latin chord structure.\n\nYesterday's News closes the album, and is a folky acoustic track that tackles how to move on in life when it seems like your best days are behind you. The mix slowly builds up as more instruments are introduced.\n",

Sometimes calamitous and assertive; sometimes gentle and tenuous. Strong influences such as Opeth, Tool, and Porcupine Tree can be heard throughout, mixing with HTM?s style and grace.\n\nAfter several attempts at a normal band experience, he finally decided the only way to make the music he truly wanted was to do it himself. Thus Heir to Madness thrust itself upon humanity. The name Heir to Madness is derived from the idea that we are all inheritors of madness; the madness of mind, ego, and separation.\n",

    "description": "\"Man I feel different now!\" Eric Winzenried exclaims from the Hollywood Drunks albums' title track \"Swell\". It's a feeling that we all experience at various stages in our lives. We wake up and suddenly everything has changed but we're not sure how or why. You're just not the same person. \"Swell\" is a coming of age album for a new adulthood. In Winzenried's case, it's one that has been severely delayed.\n\nOnce again combining an eclectic mix of musical styles, The Hollywood Drunks second album is a free for all of pop, rock, reggae, hip hop, and alternative. And lyrically, whether he's crooning or flowing, his style is all over the map as well. It represents his life as an artist, always changing and evolving, never staying in the same place. But what remains constant is his honesty and his ability to laugh at himself and his life.\n\n\"Swell\" is an album that's both humorous and reflective. It's about adapting to the new circumstances and obstacles life likes to throw in our way.\"That Age\" follows the aging process as it recognizes that, with each new year we're on this planet, more and more friends will drop out of our lives. And whether it's due to their death or that they're just sick to death of us, we experience and mourn each loss. He sets a somber tone in \"Lonely Feeling\" which explores emotional loss. But then, follows it with the humorous \"Wake You\", where Eric, attending a friend's party, laments the loss of his youth realizing, \"Over half the people there I could've been their father.\" Entering the mind-blowing age of parenthood is sensitively addressed in, \"Getting Young.\" You can almost see the bemused smirk on his face as he tries to convince himself and us that through each change he \"feels swell in a perfectly unusual way.\" And his enthusiasm is contagious.\n\nThe Hollywood Drunks are able to make us laugh at the absurdities in life, all the while encouraging us to live each day as if it's our last. and by the end of \"Swell\" we can see the power and beauty of accepting each face-slapping change that life blindsides us with and we, too, feel \"Swell\".\n\nEric Winzenried - Vox\nLloyd Stuart Casson - Guitars, Bass\nCarl West - Bass\nPaul Sandberg - Keys\nSebastian Sheehan - Drums and Percussion\n",

The three horns, and sometimes flute, combine with the electronic guitars and keyboards to create instrumental textures that work perfectly with the music they play.\n\nSome album highlights include \"Peace\" with its classic mid-90s trip-hop down tempo beat and lush vibratoed chords on the electric piano, and \"Suriname\" which opens with smooth horn orchestrations backing an exotic synth melody that recalls the old Don Ellis experimental big band. This is a very creative and well executed album. To the serious post bop fan this album may seem a little light, but these players are not light weight at all, they just prefer to keep their cool, with their tongues planted in cheek.\n(A review of One Life Left from the Jazz Music Archives website).\n",

    "description": "How did it all begin.... probably in a long cherished wish to play Erik Satie's Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes (originally written for the piano) on the lute. Having fulfilled that wish and thinking of recording Satie, I asked myself which lute composer could stand next to Satie? The answer came quickly in the form of Robert Ballard, Musicien Ordinaire du Roy. Ballard's music is quintessentially French: as with Satie, his compositions are exquisitely refined and 'courteous'. Perhaps because of this shared quality of serenity, when one hears their music side by side the distance of 300 years which divides these two Parisians quickly fades away. However, when one returns to earth, Paris, as one of the greatest cultural centers of Europe, also took many foreign composers to her heart. Among these was Fernando Sor. His intense and romantic Fantaisie Elegiaque for guitar, with its highly concentrated emotional content, forms a most 'earthy' contrast with the more ethereal and transparent tones of Ballard and Satie.\n\nContemplations\nBeing descended from a family of music publishers and lutenists Robert Ballard (ca 1572 - after 1650) possessed all the genetic material required to grow into one of the more prominent lutenists of his time. His father, Robert Ballard senior, founded, together with his cousin Adrian le Roy, the famous music publishing house 'Le Roy et Ballard'. When Maria de Medici, the French regent, was looking for a lute teacher for the Dauphin Louis XIII, she chose Ballard's son Robert. Ballard junior wrote two books of lute music: Premier Livre de tablature de luth (1611) and Diverses Pieces mises sur le luth (1614). From 1618 onward he was allowed to bear the title Musicien Ordinaire du Roi. The Entree's, Courantes and Ballets, which are here performed on a 10-course gut-strung lute (after Gerle, Brian Cohen 1979), are from the first lute book. In addition to having certainly played them, Louis XIII probably used them as a subtle accompaniment to his dance.\n\nBorn in Spain, the composer and guitar virtuoso Fernando Sor (1778-1839) received his music education from the Benedictine monks of Montserrat. With the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte he left Spain for Paris, where he soon became well known. Sor is especially famous for his large oeuvre for guitar, but he also wrote operas, symphonies and ballets. Most of these are lost. As a performing guitarist he traveled widely throughout Europe. In addition to his many concerts in Paris, where he remained for most of his life, he gave performances in other large cultural centers such as London, Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow. Sor composed the Fantaisie Elegiaque (1836) after the death in childbirth of a dear friend and pupil. Its melodies, which are moving as well as charming are grouped into sharply contrasting phrases which follow each other in quick succession, a characteristic which might well have pleased his fellow Parisian Frederique Chopin.\n\nOn this album Sor is being played on a Stauffer guitar (1830) copied by Martin de Witte in 2011. Its strings are of gut and silk.\n\nFor the 'self-made' composer and Rosicrucian (a secret philosophical society) the music of Erik Satie (1866-1925) was conceived in a very architectural manner: as if assembling a construction kit, he formed his compositions from audible building blocks, not shrinking from seemingly interminable repetitions. Today Satie is mostly famous for his Trois Gymnopedies (1888) and his Trois Gnossiennes (1890) which, because of their long drawn-out melodies and their repeated chord patterns, can easily put Satie's listeners into a trance-like state. To fit them into the range of the 14 course liuto attiorbato the Gnossiennes and Gymnopedies have been transposed down a fourth and a fifth respectively. To preserve Satie's harmonies virtually unaltered it was necessary to develop a new right hand technique. Satie's often soft and mysterious sound combinations translate surprisingly well onto the gut-strung liuto attiorbato (De Witte 2007, after Choc 1630).\n",

    "name": "Indian Summer of the Lute",
    "description": "The album \"Indian Summer of the Lute\" presents the fairly unknown repertory for baroque lute from the time of the sons of J.S. Bach and of the young Mozart. These compositions in a pre-classical style bring out a surprisingly expressive aspect of the lute.\n\nJohann Friedrich Daube, Rudolf Straube and Ferdinand Seidel composed their music in a period during which the expression of individual feelings was paramount. Whereas before, the religious and worldly majesty were the major source of inspiration for composers, in this period the individual stood at the center. Because the melody was considered to be the carrier of feelings, composers thought of polyphony as an unnecessary distraction. As a consequence of this swing in musical language new instruments, such as the Forte-piano, were developed and concert life shifted from the courts increasingly to places open for the public. Because of these changes the lute lost its function and came to be thought of as old-fashioned.\n\nIn spite of these developments German composers kept writing for the lute until as late as the 1790s. Typical for this Indian Summer of the lute is the respectable number of solo sonatas written for it. Also in chamber music the lute played an important role in the works of composers such as J. Krebs, J.B. Hagen, Toeschi and G. Haydn. Though declining in most European countries, in the German speaking ones the lute was given a new language. In a word the lute had to become 'outspoken' and through this transformation it experienced a beautiful Indian Summer.\n",

    "description": "Meditations is the third CD by Ishwish. With Meditations, Christopher Currell (composer, musician and producer) has gone much deeper with his concept of using sound vibrations to raise human consciousness. Meditations are five musical/sound collages that are designed to resonate specifically with the human spirit and the universe. The harmonious interaction of spirit and sound sets free information that is contained within the vibration. This information holds the key to elevating consciousness. Each person resonates differently, much like a radio tuner, and therefore has his own unique experience. Each person receives only information that they are ready to receive based on their own current awareness and life experiences.\n\nChristopher says this about the powerful harmonious interaction of music and meditation:\n\n\"Light is the creative source. The universe is an echo of the creative source...fundamentally a vibration. Everything is a result of a creative thought. The spiritual essence of man is interested in trying to understand the nature of the creative source. Science is about analyzing its results. Meditation stills the vibration long enough to perceive its source. Music is a process that resonates directly with the creative source. Meditations are pathways to consciousness. Sound illuminates the way. May your travels be guided from the darkness into the light.\"\n",

Godowsky was a celebrity in his day: Artur Rubinstein said that \"it would take him 500 years\" to acquire Godowsky's technique. Rachmaninoff wrote that \"Godowsky is the only musician of this age who has given a real, lasting contribution to the development of the piano\".\n\nBut following Godowsky's death in 1938, his compositions were largely ignored until the year 2000, when super-virtuoso pianists such as Marc-Andre Hamelin and Boris Berezovsky began to record and perform his works in concert.\n\nIvan Ilic is the latest pianist to rise to the formidable challenge. His album focuses on the 22 Studies for the left hand alone, considered among the most difficult pieces ever written for the instrument.\n\nBut there is a poetry in Ilic 's interpretations which makes one forget the difficulty, and allows the listener to bask in Godowsky's rich, dark re-working of Chopin's masterpieces.\n\nThis album is a tour de force of virtuosity and musicianship.\n\n- Daily Telegraph Classical CD of the Week\n- Classique News Top 5 CD of the Month\n\n\"A major achievement\"\nBBC Radio 3\n",

    "description": "Imagine a peace-filled primitive world where the atmosphere is painted with swirling ambience, where intense tapestries of sound envelope and enrich every aspect of life. A world in which the air breathes and the wind has a mind and life of its own. A world where meditation is common and spiritual response is immediate and uplifting. This is a world of fantasy, a world of mystery, and a world of beauty. You can keep imagining this world, or you can pick up the new Ivilion release, Terean, and experience it for yourself in surround sound.\n\nTerean is the culmination of Michael Weeks' previous works with Ivilion, pulling in and adding to the structures started in his first release, Sartinal, and making use of the darkly melodic concepts from his unofficial release, What I see in the dark. I recently had the pleasure to review his other project, The Wretch, and I cannot enforce the difference between these two projects enough. While The Wretch takes listeners on a fast-paced trip through a schizotypal, A.D.H.D. crazed mind, Ivilion serves to take listeners on an intrinsic journey through their own psyche.\n\nTerean is characterized by perpetual, evolving tribal beats, crafted on a base of dark, drifting ambience, and given life by the beautiful melodies throughout. Delicate, haunting string and piano arrangements visit songs, adding strength and body to the overall value of this work of art. While some ambient works are sparsely layered, change little, and drone into nothingness, Terean weaves its way into the listener's mind, taking over the subconscious and inspiring 44 minutes and 44 seconds of thought and meditation.\n\nIf you don't like tribal drums and ambience, I don't have to tell you that you probably won't enjoy this album. But if you have even a passing interest, I can promise Ivilion's Terean is for you. The production on this release is impossibly flawless; the sound is amazing and inspiring. With Terean Michael Weeks shows an absolute command over his resources, turning what can be a dull and stale genre into a living masterpiece. I fully intend to dwell on this release for quite some time, and will be strongly suggesting it to anyone I meet.\nReview by: Shaun Phelps\n",

    "name": "Josquin des Prez Lute Settings",
    "description": "The stature of Josquin des Prez (c.1450-1521) is without question, indeed he is credited with being the mastermind behind the transition of music from of the Middle Ages into the renaissance. His output is for the most part vocal music, masses and motets, so this recording is unusual in as much as it is made up of settings of vocal music in a purely instrumental context, that being the solo lute. This process known as intabulation was undertaken by a number of 16th century lutenists and vihuelaistas (the vihuela being the Spanish equivalent of the lute) that obviously held Josquin des Prez in high regard. Surprisingly enough we are told by Jacob Heringman, in the inlay notes, that intabulation represents the largest proportion of all the known lute literature and this disc being the first to be made up entirely of intabulations.\n\nSome of the composers who took Josquin des Prez' music as inspiration are familiar to me such as Valentin Bakfark (c.1526-1576) from Transylvania, Hans Newsidler (c. 1509-1563) from Germany and the Spaniards Miguel Fuenllana (early 16th century) and Alonso Mudarra (c. 1510-1580). Probably the best known work contained here is Luys de Narvaez' (fl.1530-1550) 'La cancion del Emperador' taken from his collection 'El Delphin de Musica' published in Valladolid, in 1538, this being a setting of Josquin de Prez' 'Mille regretz' said to have been a favourite song of Charles V of Spain.\n\nJacob Heringmans authentic sound and playing style suits this music perfectly, although it does take repeated listening to reap the rewards. For the most part though I do feel that this disc is more of a historical document for early music enthusiasts and scholars rather than a purely entertaining experience.\nAndy Daly\n\nThis is a disc of arrangements: sixteenth-century arrangements for lute (and its Spanish counterpart, the vihuela) of vocal music by the greatest of renaissance composers, Josquin Desprez. The arrangements, from Italy, Spain, Germany and France, are by the leading lutenists of the early and mid sixteenth century; the earliest is by Spinacino (1507) from the first surviving published book of lute music; the latest is by the Transylvanian virtuoso Valentine Bakfark, from the Cracow Lute Book of 1565 (which also includes Bakfark's setting of the splendid four-part motet \"Qui habitat in adjutorio\" -- see my previous DGM CD, Black Cow).\n\nIntabulation is the \"official\" name for an instrumental arrangement of a vocal piece. The sixteenth-century solo lute and vihuela repertoire can be divided into three categories:\n\n1) fantasias and other freely composed pieces\n2) dances\n3) intabulations of vocal originals\n\nA cursory survey of sixteenth-century lute music, both in manuscripts and in printed books, shows that intabulations form the largest category. And yet this category is largely unrepresented in performance and in recordings today.\n\nOver a period of several years, with the help of leading scholars of lute music, I have assembled and played through as complete a list as possible of the hundreds of surviving sixteenth-century lute settings of Josquin Desprez's vocal music. After a long process of studying the intabulations and the vocal originals, I compiled this programme of some of the finest settings, and, during 1999, I toured with the programme, giving concerts in London, Turin, Vancouver and Norwich.\n\nThis is not only the first CD/concert programme ever to be devoted entirely to intabulations, it is also the first lute project ever devoted entirely to the great Josquin Desprez and to the legacy of Josquin instrumental arrangements, and much of the music has not been recorded or performed in modern times.\n\nWhy have we avoided intabulations until now? They are, after all, the meat and potatoes of the sixteenth-century lutenist's activity. Probably it is because: 1) they are difficult technically; 2) they have, in our culture of \"originality\", perhaps been thought of as somehow derivative (not unlike piano reductions of orchestral scores in the nineteenth century); and 3) the vocal originals are less well-known among lutenists and audiences today, which removes the music from its original context.\n\nI believe that none of these reasons is particularly convincing: the technical difficulty has not proven an obstacle; it's simply a matter of giving the music one's time and commitment. The musical rewards are rich. Regarding the derivative quality of intabulations and the fact that, generally, people are unfamiliar with the vocal originals, I am convinced (and audiences have confirmed) that the best Josquin lute settings are fine instrumental pieces in their own right. I like to think of these pieces as transformations of vocal music rather than as reductions. Of course a knowledge of the vocal originals greatly enhances one's appreciation of these lute pieces, but Josquin's music is of such high quality, and the best settings so skilful, that his genius shines through them. Quite simply, this is great music which needs no apology.\n\nJosquin des Prez and intabulations\nSometimes it feels as though Josquin will disappear in a whiff of smoke. Since Helmuth Osthoff's great biography of the composer (1962-5) it has become clear that a very large part of his details actually concerned other musicians -- Josquin de Kessalia at the court of Milan (d.1498), Josquin Steelant at the court of Burgundy, Josquin Doro at the court of Ferrara, Johannes Stokem (called Jo. de Pratis) at the Papal chapel, and so on. Fortunately some new documents have also been found, but our picture of his life is a lot more tentative than it once looked.\n\nThe present view is like this. He was born around the present French-Belgian border, probably in the mid-1450s, some 15 years later than once thought. His early career was not in Milan but probably at the chapel of 'Good' King Rene of Anjou (d.1480) at Aix-en-Provence and then in the Sainte-Chapelle of King Louis XI of France. After Louis died in 1483 Josquin seems to have been in Milan for a few years before joining the Papal chapel in 1489 (three years later than once thought). In 1496 he again disappears from trace, possibly returning to France; but he was certainly at the court of Ferrara for the year 1503-4, after which he moved north to Conde, where he was provost of the collegiate church until his death in 1521. What is abundantly clear, however, is that from the time when Ottaviano de' Petrucci published his first book of Josquin masses in 1502 Josquin stood as incomparably the most famous composer of the day.\n\nAn even more serious disappearing act has happened with his music. Josquin's fame in the 16th century seems to have led copyists and particularly printers to add his name to pieces of all kinds. Just over 300 works exist with his name on them in some 1000 early sources. The complete Josquin edition of Albert Smijers (finished in 1969) printed only two-thirds of these: some were unknown at the time, but in most cases their omission from the Smijers edition was already a judgment that they could not be authentic. Jeremy Noble's worklist for The New Grove Dictionary (1980) gave only 176 as being probably by Josquin. Since then the number of accepted works has continued to fall. Every few months there is another article arguing that a particular work is not really by him.\n\nSo today many Josquin scholars prefer to take a different tack, beginning from the other end. They look for works that present an overwhelming documentary case for being indeed by Josquin des Prez. Often that case includes ascriptions in several sources of independent authority, survival in sources from Josquin's lifetime or from editors who could be expected to have good information (Senfl and Glareanus, for example), and perhaps a passing reference by some writer or theorist. That approach obviously raises questions: it excludes the broader picture of what Josquin meant to hundreds of musicians in the later 16th century; and it seriously risks losing dimensions of Josquin's creativity that may just happen to be less well supported by documentary evidence. But it yields a small body of music that is of a stunningly high quality: 12 masses, some 40 motets and around a dozen songs.\n\nBut it turns out that this fairly small repertory, the hard-core Josquin, is the music that made by far the greatest impact in the 16th century. These are the works that appear in the largest number of sources (a whiff of circular argument here, but let it pass); by and large, they are the pieces that formed the basis of parody works down to the time of Lassus and Palestrina; and they are also the ones overwhelmingly preferred by the musicians who arranged his music for lute or vihuela. Among them, on this disc, are the three great six-voice motets Praeter rerum seriem, Benedicta es and Pater noster. All had a huge impact on later composers. Pater noster may be one of his last and most serene works; Josquin chose it to be sung annually in his memory at Conde. The other two may date from around 1500, and stand at the very root of the six-voice motet tradition in the 16th century. Despite the difficulties of reducing six voices to lute tablature, there are no fewer than 24 tablature sources for Benedicta es and 15 for Pater noster.\n\nSimilarly with the masses. The mass Pange lingua -- the only Josquin mass that was not printed by Petrucci, and therefore possibly his last surviving mass -- was excerpted and recopied throughout the century. And in many ways the mass La sol fa re mi, perhaps from the mid-1490s, is the most perfect of all his works. Although the vihuelist Diego Pisador famously intabulated eight entire masses of Josquin in 1552, the general pattern was to select shorter sections, which is what we find in the Spanish printed tablatures of Mudarra and Fuenllana as well as in the Venetian manuscript of Capirola (one of the earliest sources for any music of the Pange lingua mass).\n\nOf the solidly documented songs, \"Adieu mes amours\" must be one of the earliest, composed before 1480; and it was also to be one of his most successful -- known from nine tablature sources, alongside 16 staff-notation sources. And the latest may well be \"Mille regretz\", with a similar spread of sources: this work has in fact been informally doubted by some, partly because only one (much later) source supports the ascription to Josquin in Narvaez's tablature; but I have recently convinced myself that a closer examination of the evidence not only shows it to be by Josquin but also suggests that it is one of his very last works, perhaps from 1520.\n\nThe five-voice chanson \"Faulte d'argent\" (perhaps from soon after 1500) has been questioned on stylistic grounds; but the documentary case for its being by Josquin seems hard to shake, and with the shifting picture of Josquin's output it seems wise for the moment to resist stylistic judgments. The six-voice \"Nimphes, nappes\" -- a work widely distributed with the Latin text \"Circumdederunt me\" (following the borrowed chant presented in canon within the texture) -- is also among his most solidly ascribed works: it surely dates from his last years in Conde.\n\n\"Comment peut avoir joye\" (4vv) and \"En l'ombre d'ung buysonnet\" (3vv) remain hard to place within Josquin's output, though again they are among the most securely ascribed of his songs. As an intriguing teaser, this recording also includes the anonymous three-voice \"Scaramella\" setting that seems to be the basis of the more famous settings by Josquin and Compere as well as the mass by Obrecht. The anonymous piece is known from four sources (all tablatures), which is more than any of the other Scaramella settings.\n\nFor the rest, though, these later arrangements for plucked instruments give an astonishingly direct report of Josquin's most influential and loved works. In many cases one is hearing them through the medium of another musician's creativity, hearing them as they were heard in the generations after the composer's death, when he stood as the unassailable model for fine and refined music. But paradoxically it is through the eyes and ears of these later musicians that we can begin reassembling a plausible picture of Josquin des Prez.\nDavid Fallows\n",

    "description": "Born in Pressburg (modern-day Bratislava) in 1508 or 1509, Hans Neusidler (often spelled \"Newsidler\") spent the majority of his life in Nuremberg, where he was active as a lute teacher and lute maker. He died in 1563.\n\nBetween 1536 and 1549, Neusidler published eight books of lute music, which are of great importance to the history of the lute, partly because of the fine music which they contain (arrangements of German, French and Italian songs and motets; dances; preludes), ranging from music for beginners to highly ornate and virtuosic intablulations, and partly also because his books contain valuable and rare instructional material for beginning lute players.\n\nIn this recording, I present a small selection of pieces from Neusidler's published books, with the intention of showing something of the variety of his musical output. His first work (Ein newgeordent kunstlich Lautenbuch, 1536) is represented by tracks 2, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 25.

    "name": "Jane Pickeringes Lute Book",
    "description": "Jane Pickeringe's lute book, technically known as British Library manuscript Egerton 2046, is one of the finest sources of the English lute repertory, but it is also an intensely personal and poignantly evocative document. We know nothing of the life of its original owner: indeed it is pure serendipity that we know her name, for the first section of the manuscript has been lost, the damage narrowly missing the folio containing her signature and a date (1616). However, Jane's manuscript still conveys a vivid impression of her musical taste, technical attainment, and even the type of instrument she owned.\n\nIf 1616 marked the beginning of Jane's copying, both her musical tastes and her lute were quite conservative. Much of her chosen repertory is late Elizabethan or early Jacobean, and most of it requires a lute with only 6 courses: some 20 pieces require a 7-course lute, and a single piece requires a fashionable 9-course instrument. Her precise and elegant hand fills the first 36 folios, beginning with a selection of duets. This is a characteristic of many didactic anthologies compiled under the guidance of a teacher, but if Jane was learning to play the lute as she filled her book she was precocious indeed, for the very first pieces reveal the hand of a practised scribe, and require some considerable technique in performance. However such a situation could explain the conservative repertory, which would then be largely that of her teacher's generation. Demonstrable musical accomplishment was a skill much prized in young unmarried women, and it is likely that Jane would have been expected to play for her family, friends and potential suitors, as well as, one hopes, for her own enjoyment.\n\nIt appears that Jane worked on her collection fairly intensively, stopped for a period, then returned to it briefly some time later, for her distinctive tablature hand is remarkably uniform until folio 35, whereupon it changes abruptly. Only 3 pieces are added in this later writing style, one of them a duplicate of an earlier entry. Did Jane give up her lute playing, perhaps upon marriage, and return to it later in life? We shall probably never know. Most of the great English lute composers of the day - Dowland, Rosseter, Bacheler, Johnson - are represented in this collection, but Jane did not scorn simple, artless trifles, which are sprinkled liberally throughout the manuscript. She copied them into the tiny gaps remaining at the foot of several pages, after more substantial pieces had claimed most of the space, and we are indebted to her for this endearing habit. If Jane and scribes like her had not seized the opportunity offered by a few inches of blank stave, many of these appealing little tunes, drawn from a largely oral tradition, would have been lost for ever. These simple, melodious titbits serve admirably to warm up the fingers, test the tuning, and gently ease the listener into the subtle and intimate soundworld of the lute.\n\nPhilip Rosseter is best known today for his beautifully wrought lute songs, but a number of his lute solos survive. The Pavin is a highly individual work: its poignantly turned melody is faintly reminiscent of Dowland's famous \"Lachrymae\", and its divisions, tumbling through the lute's entire compass, explore unusual textures to a quite unprecedented degree. The reassuringly straightforward galliard serves as a welcome anchor for the Pavin's flights of fancy, and allows free rein to Rosseter's superb melodic gift.\n\nLute transcriptions from keyboard originals are uncommon, simply because most keyboard solos have too wide a compass and are too complex to transfer idiomatically to the lute. William Byrd's set of variations on \"My lord willoughbies welcom home\" is a rare exception, and the lute version is probably the work of Francis Cutting, who made expert transcriptions of other keyboard works by Byrd, as well as Morley. The keyboard original survives in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: here it is transposed down a fourth, the better to fit the compass of the lute, but the figurations are preserved surprisingly exactly. The tune appears in many continental sources as \"Roland\": its English title commemorates the successful return of the commander of the English troops in the Netherlands, Peregrine Bertie, eleventh Baron Willoughby de Eresby.\n\n\"Mall Symes\" is a set of variations upon a ballad tune. This particularly extended and virtuosic setting is anonymous in the manuscript, but is strongly reminiscent of other variation sets by Daniel Bacheler, such as \"Monsieur's Almain\" and \"Une Jeune Fillette\", especially in its exploitation of the extremes of the lute's register, and its use of rapid arpeggiated figures and quasi-tremolo effects.\n\nJane Pickeringe was not the only lutenist to leave a legacy in Egerton 2046; after the manuscript left her hands it was used by three other musicians, two of whom added several pieces. These all wrote for lutes with 10 or more courses, mostly using a variety of new French tunings which became popular during the 1620s and 1630s. These are characterized by narrow intervals between courses - (mostly major and minor thirds instead of the fourths of the old Renaissance lute tuning used by Jane), and thus a narrower compass overall. However they enable a few chords to be produced using mostly open strings. This gives unparalleled resonance, but a very limited range of convenient keys, hence the plethora of slightly different tunings, each lending its particular sound to one or two keys.\n\nThe next pieces jump a generation, and are part of this second layer of copying. The Coranto uses the old Renaissance tuning. In two sources it is attributed to the Parisian Charles de Lespine, who was in England in 1610-11, and its form and texture are certainly typical of French taste. Tracks 13-17 use two of the French \"accords nouveaux\": the \"Allemande\" uses \"Harpe way\" tuning, the following four require what the scribe called \"Guateir\" tuning, probably named after the volatile French lutenist Jacques Gautier, who was in England from 1617 until about 1640. \"Harpe way\" is an unusually resonant minor key tuning, with the top five courses tuned to one minor chord; it was also known as \"flat tuning\" or \"Lawrence\" tuning. \"Gautier\" tuning is almost its major key equivalent, though with the top course lowered a further semitone. It is sometimes called \"sharp tuning\". Both tunings lend a conspicuously different timbre to the lute, which is further enhanced by the open, \"brise\" texture of the writing. Initially these tunings were used for a repertory which was wholly French in origin, including new French dance forms such as the Sarabande and the Courante. However their characteristic timbres were peculiarly well suited to English folk tunes, such as we hear in tracks 15-17. Tracks 18 and 19 use yet different tunings, which illustrate the extremes of this confusing period in the lute's history. The former uses a tuning unique to this manuscript, indeed to this piece; the latter uses \"flat French\" tuning, the commonest and longest used of the accords nouveaux, which for several decades challenged the \"D minor\" tuning which we now perceive as the standard baroque lute tuning. With John Johnson's Pavin we return to Jane Pickeringe's work. Johnson was one of Queen Elizabeth's \"musicians for the three lutes\" from 1579-1594. He was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, with both his solos and his duets being widely copied. Geoffrey Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes and other devices (Leiden, 1586) includes the following tribute:\n\nWhen that Apollo harde the musicque of theise daies, And knewe howe manie for theire skill, deserved iustlie praise, He left his chaire of state, ? laide his lute away, As one abash'd in English courte, his auncient stuffe to plaie. And hyed unto the skyes somme fyner pointes to frame: And in the meane, for cunninge stoppes, gave Johnsonne all the fame.\n\nThis Pavin, in the remote key of F minor, certainly has more than its share of \"cunning stops\".\n\nDaniel Bacheler was apprenticed in the household of Sir Francis Walsingham, and later appointed a Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Anne in 1603. He was a noted composer of music for the broken consort, and many of his works for this medium are dedicated to members of the Walsingham / Sidney circle. His numerous lute solos are widely disseminated amongst surviving sources, and in 1610 two were printed in Robert Dowland's Varietie of Lute Lessons, wherein Bacheler was described as \"the right perfect Musition\".\n\nThe following \"Fantasia\" is anonymous in Jane's manuscript, but survives in Johann Daniel Mylius's Thesaurus Gratiarum (Frankfurt am Main, 1622), where it is attributed to \"Rosideri Angli generosi\". On the basis of its similarity to some of John Dowland's chromatic fantasias, it was included in the Poulton and Lam edition of Dowland's lute works, and has long been regarded as part of his oeuvre, but there is no reason to doubt Mylius's attribution.\n\nRosseter, as we have seen, was fully capable of writing such intricate, challenging works. The anonymous \"Madlay\" is a curious work, called the \"new Medly\" in the Trumbull lute book (Cambridge University Library, Add.8844). A similar work, called the \"Old Medley\", exists, and is variously attributed to John and Edward Johnson. The different sections of the present work have the flavour of popular tunes, though no specific ones can be identified; they are here provided with divisions on the repeats, in the style of an embellished pavan or galliard. The result is an exhilarating tour de force resembling a dance suite in miniature. The piece was printed, though without its divisions, as a \"Padoana\", in Matthaus Waissel's Tabulatura (Frankfurt an der Oder, 1591). It is not known which version came first, though the melodies have a distinctly English flavour.\n\nJohn Dowland needs no introduction. \"Sweet Robyne\" is a set of variations on the tune from which Ophelia sings a fragment in Hamlet IV, v, 182: \"For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy\". By the standards of the day Dowland's variations are quite restrained, complementing the poignant melody with effective counterpoint, but adding few divisions which might obscure it. This marriage of a simple ballad tune and masterly handling of the lute's sonority, encapsulates the very quintessence of the Jacobean lute repertory.\n\nIn an age when printed lute music was the exception rather than the rule, and personal anthologies were compiled from pieces circulating on individual sheets, there was little standardization, and no \"authorized\" text. Some scribes copied the divisions from their exemplar, some wrote their own into their manuscripts, others copied only the plain unadorned pieces and probably improvised embellishments afresh with each performance. The pieces performed here are as Jane Pickeringe (or her successors) copied them, with only obvious errors corrected. Where no divisions are included, Jacob Heringman has improvised his own, rather than import them from another source. The individual nuances of Jane's versions are thus preserved, a grateful tribute to a woman who unwittingly left us this priceless musical legacy and a window into her long-vanished world.\n\nRecorded February 6-8, 2001 at the National Centre for Early Music, St. Margaret's Church, York, England.\n\nInstruments used: eight-course lute after Venere, Martin Haycock, 1997, and ten-course lute by Michael Lowe, 1991.\n",

    "description": "The works on the present recording have been selected from the contents of two manuscripts produced in Tuscany during the late sixteenth century. The sources are largely the work of a single scribe whose name has been lost to us. While originating from the same hand, they are different from one another in important ways.\n\nThe \"Siena Lute Book\" (The Hague, Gemeentemuseum, MS 28.B.39) is a lengthy anthology of over 150 items that was compiled in Siena. Its highly organized layout suggests careful planning and that it may have been assembled as a preservation copy, a repository for tablatures that could be recopied into other manuscripts. It begins with fantasias and ricercars grouped according to mode and intabulations of French chansons, all for six-course lute. There follows a section of fantasias, toccatas, contrapunti upon \"La spagna,\" and untitled dances, some of which require a lute with a seventh course.\n\nBecause of the wide range and high quality of its contents as well as its careful copying, the \"Siena Lute Book\" is an outstanding source of lute music. It dates from c. 1590, but the time period of composition for its contents spans much of the 1500s. There are a number of pieces by some of the most famous lutenists of the early sixteenth-century: Francesco da Milano, Albert de Rippe, and Perino Fiorentino. The source also has arrangements of ensemble ricercars by the organist Giulio [da Modena] Segni, whose works enjoyed some popularity as lute intabulations in mid sixteenth-century publications. The chanson intabulations include those of music by Clement Janequin, Thomas Crecquillon, and Pierre Sandrin, composers whose songs were popular with lutenists and other instrumentalists from the middle to the end of the sixteenth century. Pieces more contemporary with the copying of the manuscript are those by the Neapolitans Fabritio Dentice and Giulio Severino as well as those by the Sienese composer Andrea Feliciani. Some of the works in the source are found nowhere else, which makes it an invaluable collection of sixteenth-century lute music.\n\nFour pieces in the manuscript are contrapunti (highly ornate melodies) composed upon the famous dance tune \"La spagna.\" For the present recording Jacob Heringman has reconstructed tenors (accompaniments incorporating \"La spagna\") for two of these contrapunti to create lute duets; this is likely to have been their intended manner of performance.\n\nThe other source for the works on the present recording is a manuscript preserved at the Dolmetsch Library in Haslemere (MS II C23). In its present state-some pages are missing-it is a modest collection of less than two dozen pieces for lute and guitar. Most of the compositions are for six-course lute, and they are in the handwriting of the \"Siena Lute Book\" scribe. A different hand was responsible for two pieces for seven-course lute, and a third hand copied a guitar tablature (with alfabeto notation) into the source.\n\nHaslemere contains fantasias, ricercars, dance pieces, solo intabulations of vocal music, and arrangements for voice and lute. While the casual arrangement and eclectic nature of the manuscript's tablatures indicate that it may have belonged to an amateur rather than a professional musician, the technical demands of its music suggest that the owner was a very proficient lutenist. Perhaps the \"Siena Lute Book\" scribe copied pieces into Haslemere for a highly gifted student or friend. The manuscript may have been the lute book of a member of the Medici family or household, since the Medici insignia appears in the upper left corner of the first page of tablature.\n\nOne of the ways Haslemere differs from the \"Siena Lute Book\" is that its intabulated vocal works include Italian pieces rather than French chansons. Among them are \"Nasce la pena mia\" by Alessandro Striggio, \"Vivo sol di speranza\" by Giovane Domenico da Nola (it is incorrectly attributed to Orlando di Lasso in Haslemere), and \"Vestiva i colli\" by Palestrina. These mid sixteenth-century madrigals were favorites with lutenists as solo intabulations and in arrangements for voice and lute throughout the second half of the century.\n\nThe program of the present recording features works that represent the breadth of the repertory in the manuscripts they are drawn from. They include \"classics\" by Francesco da Milano and Perino Fiorentino, later works by Fabritio Dentice and Giulio Severino, chanson intabulations, and dance pieces. Thus, the program gives us an idea of the richness of lute practice in Tuscany at the end of the sixteenth century.\nRichard K Falkenstein\n\nNotes from the lute player\n1. This piece is attributed in the manuscript to Francesco da Parigi, whose identity is a mystery. Five pieces are attributed to him in this source, but some of these are known to be by Francesco da Milano or Albert de Rippe. This Fantasia, actually not much like the work of either Francesco or De Rippe, is a fine piece, with a marvellous balance of rhapsodic passagework, and sophisticated counterpoint and dissonance.\n\n2. Next is an anonymous Fantasia which seems related to another Fantasia (21) in the Siena manuscript, attributed to Perino Fiorentino.\n\n5. This fantasia is anonymous, but strongly reminiscent of Francesco da Milano's style.\n\n7. This remarkable four-part Fantasia from the Medici Lute Book is written in strict and somewhat dense four-part counterpoint. Either it was written by a lutenist/composer with an unusually strong commitment to contrapuntal principles, or it is an intabulation of a pre-existing four-part instrumental piece. To test these ideas, I (re)arranged the piece for four instruments, and can report that it is also highly effective performed in this way.\n\n8. The \"Passemezo del giorgio\" (or \"Zorzi\") was a well-known chord progression (or ground) at the time. It survives in many versions for ensemble, for keyboard, for cittern and for lute.\n\n10. Fantasia 23 shares its first few bars with those of a Fantasia in the Barbarino Manuscript (Cracow, Mus. Ms. 40032), there attributed to Dentice. This has led to the assumption that Fantasia 23 is by Dentice. However, because only the first few bars are the same, and because there are other instances of sections of Fantasias by one composer migrating into Fantasias by another, I don't believe we can necessarily assume that this piece is by Dentice. But the extremely high quality, and the stylistic similarity to other works by Dentice, suggest that it may indeed be a case in which Dentice wrote two different Fantasias which share their opening material.\n\n13 + 14. The two lute duets are settings of La Spagna. The manuscript includes only the top line for each of these (and for two more like them), but clearly these top lines are \"contrapunti\" or trebles on the famous and extraordinarily long-lived La Spagna ground, and, like the countless other Spagna settings that survive (including the one for two lutes by Francesco da Milano), are meant to be accompanied by the Spagna tenor in some form. I have here reconstructed lute accompaniments on that basis, choosing to place the Spagna tenor at the bottom of the second lute parts as a bass line, rather than embedding it in the texture. Interestingly, some of the very last surviving settings of La Spagna (from the early 17th century) are Neapolitan. As the Siena Lute Book has a strong Neapolitan connection (through the presence of music by Severino and Dentice), it is tempting to speculate that these anonymous lute Spagnas might have a Neapolitan link.\n\n20. Although this piece is labelled in the manuscript as a Fantasia, it sounds suspiciously like an intabulation of an as yet unidentified three-part vocal original, in the light style of a villanescha or villanella or chanson rustique. The piece bears a passing resemblance to Passereau's \"Il est bel et bon\", and an even stronger relation to Certon's \"Je ne fus jamais si ayse\".\n\n21. For me, Severino's Fantasia (42) is the high point of the programme. It sums up perfectly the emotional profundity, sophistication and sweetness to be found in the late renaissance Italian lute Fantasia.\n\n22. This delightful Fantasia occurs twice in the manuscript (40 and 132). Strangely, it is attributed to Francesco da Parigi the first time it appears, and to Francesco da Milano the second time. Interestingly, the version attributed to Parigi has no bar lines. This may be significant: of the five pieces in Siena attributed to Parigi, three have no bar lines. This is a high proportion when one looks at the total number of pieces in Siena which are without bar lines, which is very small--there are only two others (discounting the later seven-course pieces at the end of the manuscript): 22 and 64.\n\n23. This piece survives in many versions from various parts of Europe. John Dowland seems to have appropriated it for his famous almain \"Lady Hunsdon's Puffe\".\n\n25. Again, many versions survive of this galliard, in manuscripts from all over Europe. These three pieces (tracks 23-25) are the last items in the Siena Lute Book, and, together with the four settings of La Spagna which precede them, are the only dance music in the manuscript.\n\n26. I conclude with another Dentice Fantasia (73). This splendid piece, with its triple-time dance-like middle section, its nearly three-octave range, and its technical demands, must surely be one of the finest pieces in the manuscript, and, indeed, one of the most memorable Fantasias of the period.\nJacob Heringman\n\nDedication\nWhile I was preparing, performing and recording this music, the West was planning and executing its war in Iraq. This has served to remind me that the lute was brought to the West more than a thousand years ago, from Eastern centres of high culture - notably Baghdad; European lutenists learned their art from Eastern masters, whose influence formed part of the basis of a renaissance lute tradition (and a modern guitar tradition). Thus the lute and its music powerfully symbolize a harmonious and fruitful meeting of East and West. I dedicate this recording to the memory of Ziryab (c790-852) and other lutenists of the distant past who brought us the lute, and to the cause of East/West harmony.\n\nThis disc was recorded at the Church of St. Michael and all Angels, Great Tew, Oxfordshire, on 19-20 September 2003 (tracks 1-3, 8-9, 13-14, 18-20), 7 November 2003 (tracks 4-7, 15-17, 23-25), and 15 December 2003 (tracks 10-12, 21-22, 26).\n\nTracks 1-3, 8-9, 13-14, 18-20: six-course lute in g' by Grant Tomlinson, Vancouver, 2002, after early sixteenth-century models\nTracks 4-6, 15-17: six-course lute in e' by Michael Lowe, Oxfordshire, 1999, after Frei (early sixteenth century)\nTracks 7, 23-25: seven-course lute in g' by Martin Haycock, East Sussex, 2001, after Gerle (c. 1580)\nTracks 10-12, 21-22, 26: six-course lute in g' by Andrew Rutherford, New York, 1997, after Gerle (c. 1580)\n\nAll four lutes were strung entirely in gut from Gamut Strings (http://www.gamutstrings.com/)\nProduced, engineered, edited and mastered by Adrian Hunter.\nLute duet arrangements (tracks 13 and 14) copyright Jacob Heringman.\nDesign and art direction by Hugh O'Donnell.

    "name": "Thesaurus Harmonicus",
    "description": "Jean-Baptiste Besard (c.1567-c.1620) published the Thesaurus Harmonicus in Cologne in 1603. It is an almost encyclopaedic collation of early 17th century lute music containing pieces by twenty-one credited composers from throughout Europe, along with many un-credited and anonymous works. These are organised into ten books, according to genre, and there is also a manual on lute playing, suggesting the publication had a didactic purpose. Most of the music is for solo lute, though there are also pieces for lute and voice and lute ensemble.\n\nAlthough he composed roughly one tenth of the pieces in the Thesaurus Harmonicus, Besard was not a professional musician. Educated in law and medicine at the Universities of Dole and Heidelberg, by around 1600 he had established himself as a lute teacher in Cologne, while continuing to practice as a lawyer and doctor. It has been suggested that he paid for the publication of the Thesaurus by working as an editor of legal texts for his publisher Grevenbruch. Besard later moved to Augsburg where in 1617 he published a second book of lute music, Novus partus, and an expanded edition of his lute tutor in German. Nothing further is known of Besard after this date.\n\nAttempting to condense a collection of music as vast as the Thesaurus Harmonicus into a one hour length recording is a seemingly quixotic endeavour and this in no way claims to be a comprehensive survey of the text. The pieces were chosen for purely personal reasons as being the most interesting, moving and outstanding works I discovered while exploring the book. Much more has been left out than is included in this collection, my intention being to create an expressive musical programme rather than an academic overview.\n\nThe Thesaurus Harmonicus contains some of the best-known lute music along with some of the most obscure. Both are presented here. The pieces by Dowland are probably the most famous works for lute, though they contain subtle variations that should make them interesting to even the most experienced listener. Many of the pieces in the collection are extremely short, especially the dance tunes. Tracks 2 and 14 are both formed of three shorter pieces put together to create a longer structure, using one of the dances as the theme in a rondo-esque structure.\n",

    "description": "One of my favorite works for organ is the great Praeludium in E flat from Bach's Clavier ubung III, which is usually followed in recital by the Fugue in E flat, called \"St. Anne's\", though in Bach's manuscript the two are separated by the entire remainder of the work, 27 pieces in all. As a harpsichordist, the temptation was too great to not adapt these and other works to my own instrument. The Praeludium especially reminds me of the French Ouverture in Clavierubung II and the Ouverture of Partita #4 in Clavierubung I, both harpsichord works. I also have a great fondness for Bach's Chorale Preludes, as well as his Fugues. Clavierubung III being organ music, often has pedal parts, though much is also for manuals alone, including the Duetti which are often performed on the harpsichord.\n\nI chose for this album pieces that both touch me musically and are playable on the harpsichord. Those with pedal parts sometimes required octave transpositions but mostly demanded I get my not so large hands to stretch more than usual. These large reaches were in part facilitated by the keyboard of the Grabner harpsichord with it's narrow key span. The piece in this set that required the most rewriting was \"Vater unser im Himelreich\" (two manuals + pedal), but being one of the most complex and moving of the entire book, I could not leave it out.\n\nFor this album I worked from the facsimile of the original publication (1739) and found some of the text to be different from \"corrected\" modern versions. Of particular note is the hair raising cross relations in the \"Fuga super Jesus Christus unser Heiland \". Bach is very specific in his notation and in order to retain an extensive canonic imitation between the bass and alto there can be no other option than what he has written (this section appears in the backdrop on the album cover). The other unfortunate \"correction\" is in Duetto IV. To my ear Bach's sometimes strange harmony is part of what makes his music so fascinating. I also love some of his allusions to the texts of the Chorales he has chosen to set, such as the great flowing river in \"Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam\".\n\nThe harpsichord, built in 2008 by John Phillips, Berkeley, is modeled after the 1722 Johann Heinrich Grabner preserved in the Villa Bertramka in Prague; the earliest of four surviving Grabner harpsichords. Although now much modified, it is a very good example of the large middle German harpsichord with which Bach would have been intimately familiar. It is even likely that Bach knew J. H. Grabner, as the latter held the position of official tuner at the Electoral Saxon court in Dresden. One of Grabner's sons, Christian Heinrich, studied organ with Bach in Leipzig. Typical of the largest German instruments of the 1720s; it has a range of FF-d3, two manuals with a sliding coupler, and a registration of two unisons and an octave. Special thanks to the owner for the use of this harpsichord and to John Phillips for his assistance, and allowing me the use of his shop for recording.\n",

    "name": "JS Bach Inventions and Sinfonias",
    "description": "Despite the sophistication of the Inventions and Sinfonias, and their value as teaching pieces of performance and compositional technique, these works were not published in Bach's lifetime, but rather in 1801, 51 years after his death. The \"simple\" version we are all presently accustomed to comes from this 1801 publication (Neue Bach Ausgabe), though we now are aware of other handwritten copies, including by Bach himself. Begun as teaching pieces for his own son, Wilhelm Friedemann, they were likely finished in Leipzig, where he moved in 1722.\n\nPerhaps \"finished\" is not quite the right word, as Bach continued to tinker with them. It is evident to me that as teaching pieces, personal instruction by Bach would have been invaluable to his pupils, as improvised ornamentation would have been encouraged, hence the varying versions that have come down to us. It is my opinion that the simpler versions were kept as such to allow for the freedom to exercise one's own taste in regards to ornamentation (within reason). Unlike Francois Couperin, who was annoyed at anyone's altering of his text, Bach expected it.\n\nIn the pupils' versions I am working from I find it interesting that in many, suggested ornamentation of the main subject only appears at the beginning. I would think the student was expected to extend the logic through the entire piece, though in my performance, I mostly stick to the text, so that you, the listener, can hear what was passed down to us. In a few cases I do carry the ornamentation a bit further, (see above) but am pretty discreet. In several of the later Sinfonias, the students' ornamentation is heavy throughout, as is also true in Bach's final versions.\n\nThe two most radically different works, in Bach's hand, are Invention #1 with triplets, and Sinfonia 5, highly ornamented in the French style. In the case of Sinfonia 5, I wonder if my simple performance is even remotely correct. I suspect not.\n\nIn this performance, I also do not play every conceivable ornament. Sinfonia 12, for example, has some appogiaturas in the subject (appearing only once), that I personally don't care for, though I suppose one could get used to them, and maybe even like them if they were carried out in all voices. The same holds true of an appogiatura in the opening subject in Sinfonia 14, which to me sounds like an interruption. It all eventually boils down to taste.\n\nI hope you enjoy this, and those of you who play, I hope this inspires you to be more free and creative with these pieces. I also feel that sticking to these pupils' versions is not essential, nor was Bach's true intent, though they are quite instructive to us now.JJ\n",

    "description": "No one casts a larger shadow over eighteenth century Spanish keyboard music than the Italian Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757). His sonatas written after 1729 are full of imitations of the guitar, and folk tunes with their distinctive rhythms, harmonies and shifts between major and minor. Scarlatti's genius is that his music preserves the intensity of its provincial elements while raising them to the level of high art. Before Scarlatti, Spanish keyboard music was mainly in the sacred contrapuntal tradition inherited from Cabezon and Cabanilles. After Scarlatti, the spinning out of contrapuntal material or sets of variations were abandoned for the Scarlatti model of secular sonata in binary form, often in sets of two or three by key.\n\nTwo of the most remarkable Spanish keyboard composers of the generation after Scarlatti are Padre Antonio Soler (1727-1783) and Manuel Blasco de Nebra (1750-1784), while the music of Juan Sesse (1736-1801) represents the sort of Spanish keyboard music that escaped the influence of Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nThe harpsichord used for this recording was built by John Phillips in 1993 and is based on mid-eighteenth century Florentine models, the cousins of the lost Spanish originals.\n",

Celtic slant.\n\nThe Mews album is a modern tribute to the space between Celtic folklore and Bluegrass music. The music pays tribute to the traditional sounds of Jigs and Reels, as well as fusing different styles and taking the musical ingredients of Celtic-American folklore one step (sometimes two steps) further. The result that you have in front of you is a collection of intriguing acoustic fusion that will delight your ears and make it almost impossible not to smile. Have a listen.\n\nNew sonic textures\nIn the eternal quest for new sonic textures, I teamed up with Gary \"Wurzle\" Cogg, prolific purveyor of handmade acoustic instruments, who graciously let me go to town on the prototype of a novel instrument he is currently developing: a three-string instrument (a \"Pickin' Pedal\") the fret pattern of which is inspired by a mountain dulcimer, usually tuned in D-A-D or similar.\n\nIts sound is strong in the high-mid frequencies and blends particularly beautifully with the concert ukulele that I have been using - a stellar piece of handiwork, with a beautifully balanced low-mid frequency body.\n\nYou can hear the two instruments combine on the \"Poetry In Motion\" track and also on \"Grace\", together with a larger acoustic ensemble. The concert ukulele has a solo on \"Symmetric Circles\", featuring the usual no-effects approach of recording two identical takes of the same instrumental part into the Left and Right stereo channels respectively.\n\nA further chapter in dynamic range\nJasmine Brunch devotees will already have noted my mild obsession with dynamic range in audio engineering - see for instance the notes on the \"4\" album at http://jasminebrunch.com/4.php. In this regard, the \"Mews\" album introduces a slightly different spin: the tracks overall are higher in loudness since most tracks feature either (a) instruments with a naturally lower dynamic range, e.g. the accordion bass, or (b) a creative approach to recording techniques, e.g. recording one of the acoustic guitar parts less than an inch away from the microphone with extremely gentle picking, leading to longer decay times relative to the peak of the acoustic signal. As a result, it was possible to retain the full dynamic range of all other instruments while giving the overall mix sufficient loudness.\n\nEaster Egg\nAlongside the usual musical subtleties that are just a little too subtle for people to realise, I wove a fairly obvious Discrete Shepard Scale into one of the tracks and will award a prize to the first listener to get his nerd on and spot it. Prize ideas include a pack of smokes or a bottle of wine or a home-cooked supper, depending on who wins.\n",

    "description": "Electro-acoustic fusion; an instrumental soundtrack to an imaginary movie.\n\nThis album is a journey through a day and its events, as seen through the eyes of the girl standing in the rain. The songs are points on that journey - dots that you connect in your mind with whatever narrative, trajectory or squiggly line feels right to you. As this is a concept album with a narrative arc, the sound clips can't really do it justice but they give you a rough idea of the sound. Musically, it's extremely homogeneous by my standards and I had to resist a number of tantalising temptations, ditching several VERY experimental tracks at the last minute. In terms of style, there is no attempt to reach any qualitative merit whatsoever (which is just as well since previous experience indicates that the latter acts as a prohibitive deterrent). It's simply soundtrack music for an imaginary movie.\n\nThis is an album designed to lose yourself in, and listen to it over and over again, so it was quite important to me, quite apart from the music being sufficiently interesting, to keep your attention, that from a sound engineering perspective, its dynamic range would be as high as humanly possible. By way of a two-word synopsis: it is.\n\nThis album is born of my (selective) quest for dynamic range in audio engineering. It's special in that regard since it's the first album where I set out to create an album with extreme dynamic range before starting the recording sessions. The album is officially a DR14 album, and even more strikingly, this is my first album without any dynamic compression whatsoever. This means that every note on every instrument resonates exactly as it would naturally. What amazed me on the first listen is that the acoustic guitar melody part in Covering Cold Feet With Warm Sheets sounds so crisp that hearing it strike the few notes it does is an entirely different experience from the way it would sound in a dynamically compressed mix. So it was great fun to lean into every note knowing that the smallest subtleties in playing would come across.\n\nThe piano part was also a special experience. A good chunk of the piano parts I write, in terms of level of difficulty, is pitched well towards the upper limit of feasibility (for me), so I'm quite grateful when in a compressed mix, I can peel away a lesser layer of difficulty by not having to pay quite so much attention to the relative volume of each key stroke. On this album, however, the differences in volume of different key strokes are utterly exposed, which has the effect of (a) sorely reminding me of how rubbish my piano playing is, and (b) sounding quite pristine in those rare moments when I get the keys to balance exactly right.\n\nSo there. I hope you like it.\n",

Features India's foremost tabla player, Subhash Karmarkar as well as Jay Kishor on sitar, Subhash Vinjamuri on violin, and Dr. P.K. Swaminathan on mridanagam. We particularly like this album in the morning, while still warming up to the day.\n",

    "description": "From West Coast Performer: Jeffrey Luck Lucas is the downcast balladeer in A Touch of Evil's lost cantina scene-an honorable stoic bearing witness to border town badness even as his own demons hatch. Between attempts to drink himself blind, Lucas manages to find solace in the stately, carefully crafted songs of Hell Then Divinean obsidian mix of traditional and alt-country, plus echoes of the Mexican folk music with which he was raised. Every tune is bathed in the steep shadow of romantic sorrow, and Lucas' running themes of rain, spilled water, and unnatural thirst are great metaphors for the raw emotional material of the album. Lucas' voice has an appealingly weathered quality, and it stands out nicely against a big night sky of instrumentation provided by friends and fellow troubadours. Chris Mulhauser's (Aphrodesia) electric guitar is soulfully rippled, and engineer Desmond Shea (Tarnation, Court and Spark, Dieselhed) brings in everything from an Optigan to a dulcimer. Lucas' cello and violin arrangements deserve special praise as a particularly beautiful presence in the music. Warm and ascendant, they're the lantern we need to see our way clear of such cavernous regret, and they show unexpected but deep sympathy for Adam Anderson's lap steel. Standout tracks too many to mention, just listen.\n",

    "description": "This stunning new album with mezzo-soprano Jennifer Lane commemorates the 250th anniversary of George Frideric Handel's passing (1685-1759). It contains lesser known vocal and instrumental gems from throughout Handel's career. From the much adored but rarely performed cantata: \"Udite il mio consiglio,\" composed at the court of Cardinal Ruspoli in Rome during the Vatican's ban on opera, to glorious excerpts from the English oratorios Jephtha, Hercules and Saul, composed during a similar ban on Italian opera in England, these works of genius are unjustly overshadowed by Handel's new testament sacred works, particularly Messiah, and those few of his operas regularly offered by the world's opera houses. Also included on this album is the rapturous Sonata in D Major for Violin and Continuo two arias from the opera Atalanta, and an aria from one of Handel's earliest Italian operas, Rodrigo. For many years, it was believed that the cantata: \"Udite il mio consiglio,\" the centerpiece of this recording, ended with the Rodrigo aria \"Allor che sorge.\" Handel's 19th century editor, Karl Friedrich Chrysander, found ending the cantata with a recitative too radical and was certain an aria had to be missing. This recording allows the listener to hear the cantata either way. You be the judge!\n\nSome of Handel's most complex women are portrayed here as well as some of his most endearing boys, according to the 18th century tradition in which sopranos and mezzos took leading roles of both genders: Hercules' wife Dejaneira's jealousy; Jephtha's faithful wife Storge's shock at the news of their daughter's impending sacrifice; David's love for Jonathan; and Meleagro's youthful love and passion for Atalanta.\n\nFull texts and translations and the orchestra list for the album are included in the artwork documentation that accompanies the download.\n",

    "description": "Neo-classical new age solo piano.\n\nFor those of us with a taste for quiet reflection.\nWe breathe in the fragrant delight that lives within this gloriously full moment.\nAnd we are inspired by the sacred space that opens up within us. Welcome.\n\nPassions And Fantasies is a deliciously subtle sensory feast of enchanting solo piano harmonies, in a flowing neo-classical new-age style. This music inspires us with inner peace and delight, and even helps manifest our sacred space within. Inspired by the elegant neo-classic fantasy miniatures of Chopin, Satie, Faure, and Debussy, Joel's sound world awakens and delicately nurtures the rich space of timeless beauty that exists within our soul. We discover delicious atmospheric delights flowing as a musical stream within our heart - a rippling breeze that gently awakens and liberates the scent in the flower fields of our mind.\n\nWhen we let the harmonies gently activate those rare, yet subtle essences within us that have been forgotten amidst the chaos of daily modern life, we breathe a sigh of relief. This music lets time expand in a curiously wonderful way, as the spiritual gift of each song resonates within our heart and soul. This music frees us to embrace the infinite sacred space that truly exists within each enchanted moment in time.\n\nWe tend to think of passion as being extravagant or ungrounded, but passion has a centered and balanced expression as well... Ancient mystic sages have said that passion, joined to spiritual awareness, becomes a unifying mystical experience. We discover this by gently breathing into the richness of this moment, enjoying it, and feeling our heart and mind savor the taste of this subtle experience. As we become gently focused and centered in each wonderful musical moment, this reveals the sacred divine space within us. Our sacred space within includes our living individual self, and also includes the infinite universe... a paradox that brings a smile to our heart.\n\nWhen the 19th century neo-romantics and impressionists were expressing their flights of musical fantasy, they were gently extending the musical language from the structured classical musical principles that came before them. They were revealing how freely flowing fantasy can be passionately expressed within a stabilizing - yet flowing and evolving - musical structure. This shows us how passions and fantasies can flourish within the balanced presence of mindfulness and harmony. These are not contradictions, but give us hope that we can learn to be peacefully centered and passionately alive to our highest ideals in each moment.\n\nAnd so it is that we can unite the neo-classic ideals of balance with the loftily expansive impulses of the new age. Just as the yin-yang symbol expresses the unity of polarities, so too can neo-classical new-age music be its own living yin-yang symbol that heals us with its unifying and expansive harmonies.\n\nMay we let our passions find delightful expression within the sacred space of each mindful breath we take. And may we discover that our fantasies for a peaceful and enlightened world are more than fantasies, because they are the true impulses of our soul, seeking to express the timeless realities and infinite possibilities of peace, happiness, and harmony in this world.\n",

    "description": "The harpsichord music of Jean-Henri D'Anglebert boasts an extraordinary richness of texture and a dense tapestry of ornaments. The many small ornamental figures, liberally added like embroidery to the dances that make up the majority of the harpsichord pieces, result in a sumptuous variety of detail, an elegant subtlety that mirrors the elegance and richness of Louis XIV's court. Yet underneath this brocade of ornamentation, D'Anglebert's music is fundamentally both simple and lyrical.\n\nThe three Suites presented on this album offer a rich combination of passion and turbulence coupled with a reflective and at times majestic soundscape. The range of experience offered by D'Anglebert is impressive as the listener is urged along from periods of introspection to episodes of agitated brilliance.\n\nAmong the many wonderful works included on this album is The Tombeau de Mr. de Chambonnieres, an elegiac piece written for D'Anglebert's teacher, Jacques Champion de Chambonnieres. It has been hailed as one of the great harpsichord pieces of the seventeenth century. Although this is an instrumental piece not associated with a text, the listener receives its message of grieving and tribute just as clearly as if it had words, perhaps more so, since music can speak at an even deeper level than words.\n",

The style is classical with a touch of Spanish flamenco and latin American rhythms, with flairs of Nordic tones. Fantasia is an almost meditative album ideal for immersion with its beautiful and very catchy melodies.\n\nFantasia closed the door on a life changing episode for Kaare. For over two years ago, he and his then wife, quite without warning were attacked by an assailant at a cafe in Aarhus. The senseless violence sent him to hospital and headlines. Luckily, his hands were not hurt, but the experience drove him deep into despair and heavy smoking. He was afraid of dying, afraid to live and afraid that he would ever play again. Through intensive therapy there was light at the end of the tunnel and through the damage and subsequent rebuilding, Kaare says it has changed his personality. Fantasia is music for the soul in the classical tradition of colored Nordic, Spanish and latin American tones. But at the same time it is blended with a meditative calm for thought. Many of the songs express pain, but, also a great love for life, for example. in \"Tango Amore\". Kaare Norge was notably known for his guitar version of Jacob Gade's \"Tango Jalousie\". Now he's made his whole tango. \"It is the classical music that is my beginning and where my heart is. Popular music and rock is my playtime. I will continue to experiment, and out of this pain I have had other doors open on to more creative outlets.\"\n",

    "description": "Cello Circles is an album of improvised cello and acoustic guitar with rich musical textures and beautifully crafted original compositions. Hear the many colors and nuances of the cello, the Emperor of the Orchestra.\n\nKalyan's playful approach to the cello merges with eight compositions that celebrate the music and sound of one of the most loved instruments of the classical orchestra. With tones of depth, beauty and joyous spontaneity, Kalyan's cello soars higher and higher on the rich textures of Sambodhi Prem's guitar.\n\nRecorded between 2001 and 2008 Cello Circles has taken its own time to come to a point of completion. Started as a fun project between friends living on opposite sides of the globe, this album organically grew into a richly orchestrated ode to the many colours and nuances of the cello.\n\nSambodhi Prem has been a recording artist with releases dating back to the mid-eighties, mostly guitar-based instrumental music and introspective titles for relaxation.\n\nKalyan is a classically trained cellist and multi instrumentalist, with skills on stringed and wind instruments. This album has his cello in the main role, but there are also plenty of minor roles for a host of interesting instruments that he plays.\n\nThe Indian dilruba is heard on two pieces, plucked on the intro of 'Leaving Space' and bowed on the last piece 'Spring Water', the Japanese kyotaku flute can be heard on 'This Moment'. And there are the more familiar sounds of the fretless bass and the recorder, all played by Kalyan.\n\nBy no means is this an album of world-music mishmashes, the tone is focussed on the cello but there's enough breathing space for many other sounds to have a place. Most pieces are 'down-tempo', but with a constantly changing landscape of sounds.\n\nThe compositions were written by both players - Sambodhi did most of the production and the recording of the backing tracks. You can hear that lots of thought went into the compositions, as the music is never repetitive and it holds your interest even after repeat listenings.\n\nSambodhi Prem says:\n\n\"My collaboration with Kalyan has been a wonderful journey of reaching across physical oceans, but with a musical closeness and creative richness - resulting in 8 compositions where the sound of the cello merges with my guitar, the textures of my studio, and the range of other instruments that Kalyan plays.\n\nDuring the recording of Cello Circles I was mostly living \"down-under\" in Australia and New Zealand, while Kalyan lives in Canada. We collaborated from afar, working together for the love of music, for our own entertainment, until we found that music had emerged which we felt to share with more people than just our closest friends.\n\nAt the heart of this music is improvisation - the starting point that guides us when we create. Add a little bit of musical luck and a few blessings from the gods of technology, plus a heavy dose of work to bring things to completion - making music is a bit like cooking - timing and tasting is everything.\n\nOver the course of this recording, which started in 2001 and was released in September 2008, I've fallen in love with the sound of the cello. Kalyan's approach towards the instrument is playful, yet deep. His meditative energy makes the instrument the perfect vehicle for his musical expression. Being an experienced musician on Indian instruments like the dilruba and the rudra veena gives him a point of reference very few cellists have. He brings so much to the instrument and to this project, I feel truly honored to be working with him.\n\nI love the cello because it's able to express great depths of sadness and is equally able to reach the heights of joy - expressing a special kind of joy - a joy that has a depth unique amongst musical instruments.\n\nI also want to mention that I've been fortunate having Sandipa help me with the delicate process of making music long-distance and receiving her great support. She created a beautiful painting, Harmony in Lily Flat Major, while this album was being recorded which you can see on the cover.\n\nOne of the best things in my life is to create music with a friend and feeling the connection and shared understanding when all the pieces fall into place and there is an expression of both our uniqueness, merged into one flow. I have experienced this while playing in a live setting, but to have that same feeling on a recording has been a most wonderful gift.\"\n\nWhat people are saying about Cello Circles:\n\n\"A big and hearty congratulations on your orchestral and sonic triumph of sound and soul with your gifted as well colleague Kalyan. You are both genius of creating a sonic tapestry that is masterful. Each of you give us so many voices to listen to and as a cellist I would have to say that Kalyan is a first rate modern jazz and world music cellist and like you exhibit gifts as a multi instrumentalist. You are both stunning and profound, congratulations.\"\nDavid Darling, Grammy Award Winning Composer and Cellist and Founder of Music For People, USA\n",

    "description": "Johann Sebastian Bach's harpsichord music perfectly embodies the sometimes contradictory nature of the instrument. From the languid lute-like textures borrowed from the French clavecinistes, to the abstract clarity that made it the supreme vehicle for the rigor of his counterpoint, Bach's music blends these elements with such mastery that it achieves a timeless crystallization of the sensual and the intellectual, the antique and the modern. His compositions define the harpsichord at least as much as the harpsichord, above all other instruments, defines Bach.\n\nCommentators have pointed to French influence in many of Bach's works; but the style and spirit of the great French harpsichord tradition is perhaps best expressed in the Partitas, in spite of their Italianate title. The form of an overture followed by a suite of dances has its roots in the operas of Lully; by Bach's time, this framework had been so thoroughly appropriated by German composers that one may speak of a distinctly German style of suite. Here, however, the dances are so ethereal and textural that they could have come from the pen of Couperin. Only the counterpoint of the Overture and the muscular gravity of the Capriccio are unambiguous in their provenance.\n\nThe youthful Toccata in E minor harkens back to the models of Italian masters like Frescobaldi. Improvisatory sections alternate with abstractions of the recitato style before giving way to a rhythmically driven three part fugue on an unusually busy theme.\n\nThe Fantasy and Fugue in A minor does not appear in any of Bach's published collections and follows the model he would later exploit so kaleidoscopically in the Well-Tempered Clavier. The Fantasy is based on a descending tetrachord, which gives it a nostalgic, harmonically static feel, while the long, dense, chromatic double fugue that follows balances the work with unmatched severity.\n\nThe Prelude, Fugue and Allegro in Eb major may have been originally composed for lute, and the long sections on pedal tones of the Prelude are at the very least imbued with the spirit of that instrument. In the following double fugue, Bach employs a unique compositional tactic: a full \"da capo\" recapitulation of the opening page, giving the listener a rare second chance to appreciate his deft juggling of the thematic material. The rollicking finale in triple meter completes and complements one of his sunniest keyboard compositions\n\n- written by Gonzalo X. Ruiz\n",

    "description": "Boismortier: Harpsichord music\n\nJoseph Bodin de Boismortier was born in 1689 in the Age of Enlightenment, a period of enormous optimism. By 1724 he had begun to self publish, and he achieved great financial success without having to rely on the largess of patrons. His music is elegant, witty and charming - but mostly written for players of modest technical ability, his amateur customers. Nonetheless, his near contemporary, Jean-Benjamin La Borde, wrote of his work in 1780 that \"whoever takes the trouble to search through this abandoned mine will find enough bits of gold to make an ingot.\"\n\nThe four suites on this album are the only works for solo harpsichord in Boismortier's huge output. The music fits the instrument so beautifully that it surely counts among the gold. Each movement bears a feminine title, many of which call to mind specific ladies in the composer's circle. La Choquante, for example, is the one who loves to shock!\n\nThe album ends with five keyboard transcriptions from the last scene of Boismortier's ballet-comique, Don Quichotte [chez la Duchesse] of 1743. Drawing on example of his close contemporary, Jean-Phillip Rameau, the artist has arranged the aird and dances of the final scene. In keeping with the French craze for things exotic - and having nothing at all to do with Cervantes' story - a contingent of Japanese people arrives, singing \"Vole, Amour, regne sur nos ames!\" - Fly, Love, reign in our hearts!\n",

Music to help to you relax, unwind, meditate, go to sleep, recharge your batteries, refresh your inner self, rejuvenate your spirit, think, ponder, wander, meander, remember.\n\nIf your life is busy and you feel bombarded by noise, images or deadlines, Still Waters will help you unwind, de-stress, relax and find a peaceful sanctuary. Suitable for massage, reading, creating, work, quiet times, before bed or to calm your children.\n\nListeners' comments:\n\"Mesmerizingly beautiful; \"thoughtful, meditative, centred\"; \"enriching, soothing, uplifts me to a different spiritual level\"; \"it helps my body to relax\"; \"I use it to study.\"\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\nThis music is still - the movement is slow and gentle and has an innate tranquillity and slowness. In our sometimes overwhelmingly busy and stressful lives, Still Waters creates a quiet haven of serenity, a cool spring of peacefulness where your weary body and beleaguered spirit can be restored and feel refreshed. Some pieces have a slow, rocking movement, reminiscent of a mother rocking her child. Others are circular, returning to a familiar theme. Some have a deliberately slow tempo, to lower the heartbeat and blood pressure. Others make use of a 'pivot note' - one note around which others move - with the analogy of one steady point from which we take our bearings.\n\nKeri Newdigate says: \"I like to think of some of the pieces as tone poems, where there is a simple melody, but the music is atmospheric and has a sense of narrative. There are some intervals which almost have a physical effect on me, eg octaves. They make me feel strong and connected to myself. When I use other intervals like the fourth or fifth, it feels 'pure' to me, as well as stable and solid, as if standing on firm ground. \"I love to sit and meander musically at the piano, listening to the overtones of the piano, and allowing the music to be 'called out' of me. As I explore intervals and tone combinations, a musical motif often arises, and I follow it to see what emerges.\n\nMy compositions usually surface organically, especially when I am 'tuned in' to the piano, and my soul is engaged in the listening process. In this state of flow and contemplation, I often feel deeply spiritually restored and refreshed and am aware of a sense of inner healing taking place. \"I like to think that my music will assist lateral thinking, that there would be a sense of spaciousness, an opportunity to 'go anywhere', to allow the mind to float where it will and take you on an inner journey. The music is not meant to interrupt or interfere with the flow of thought, but to enhance your experience and create a sense of peace.\"\n\nSOOTHE YOUR CHILD\nMothers have used it to calm their children. Cindy says \"we always use it at the end of the day when we're driving home. It helps the children to chill\". Kerryn and Sunelle, both Music Therapists, used it to settle their children down to sleep at night. Kerryn: \"This CD was my lifeline! I used it almost every night (and day) for the first 2 years of my son's life. It is the most peaceful bedtime music... and best of all, it is not electronic! It soon became his sleep association and after a long day, it was soothing for me too! It is now my baby shower gift of choice.\"\n\nSunelle: \"The music on Still Waters became a very special part of the bedtime routine with my baby, Ben. The beautiful music contributed to creating a calm and soothing atmosphere - perfect for settling a baby. Even today, at 18 months, Ben still loves the music. It takes both of us back to that very special time and it has become our special music to cuddle to.\"\n",

    "description": "I believe that after listening to Kerry Politzer's latest offering, Blue In Blue, listeners will be wondering why they've never heard of her before. I believe that she should be a household name (at least in households where people listen to jazz). Hopefully this recording will put her closer to that.\n\nKerry Politzer has everything you would want in a jazz pianist: chops, invention, tone, emotion, rhythm and originality. She has influences and depth in her improvisation and her composition, but she clearly has her own sound and her own unique thought process. \"Desolation or Hope\" is representative of this. It's essentially a tone poem, harmonically and compositionally advanced and yet it has a simple message and a singularity which makes a great improvisational vehicle. On \"Early Spring Chill\", Kerry shows her magnificent ear for melody but also her ability to use harmony to give us an emotional journey.\n\n\"November\" is such a simple melodic idea but it sets and mood so perfectly. This tune might become a standard jazz tune in the future. Kerry shows off not only her marvelous playing but her comping skills behind the incredible saxophonist Donny McCaslin.\n\n\"Washington Park\" is a great trio tune: deceptively simple sounding but the form is irregular. Kerry is able to make this irregularity seem natural in her composing and improvisation. Bassist Paul Beaudry provides the perfect balance of solid support and loose playful interaction. You can clearly hear Kerry's love of Brazilian music on \"Shifting Clouds\"; again, she makes it seem easy. 7/4 time can seem lopsided, but not on this performance. This is a really nice quartet version of the song. A lot of rhythmic drama occurs. \"Brazilian Accents\" obviously shows the influence of Hermeto Pascoal, but it actually started out as a compositional exercise during her study with Charlie Banacos. And \"Sing\" is a beautiful samba melody, very typical of Jobim or Chico Buarque. Kerry's solos show her understanding of the samba feel, so organic and distinctive. \"What Will Be\" is another potential jazz standard. The tune is masterfully constructed, taking simple ideas and tossing them around in a highly artistic and unpredictable way. The rhythmic interplay is on a very high level on this track. It's kind of in a Chick Corea's\" Now He Sings, Now He Sobs\" vein, but dare I say even more rhythmically advanced. \"Blue in Blue\" and \"Left Unsaid\" are two very intense ballads which show a brooding emotionalism which is wonderful to witness. This is where the listener will hopefully forget about whether this is a jazz record or what have you, and just revel in the moment, and ultimately be moved by the music of Kerry Politzer.\n\nby George Colligan\n",

This American 8-voice ensemble, based in the SF Bay Area,, performs the enchanting harmonies of the Balkan region \"with flawless intonation, rhythmic precision and consistent beauty of tone...The melodies' unusual harmonies, rooted in village cultures ancient and earthy, include striking juxtapositions and rhythmic sophistication.\" (Jason Serinus, Bay Area Reporter) Recorded in the sublime acoustic environment of Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California, The Vine also features well-known instrumentalists Peter Maund (percussion), Shira Kammen (rebec and vielle), Linda Tillery (cajon and djembe) and Cheryl Ann Fulton (lever harp).\n\nThe Vine begins with a beautiful arrangement of a Bulgarian song Subrali Sa Se Subrali , which tells the mysterious story of a group of young women spinners who lie down to sleep. Upon awakening, they discover various pieces of clothing and jewelry missing. An interplay between the quotidian and the symbolic, the particular and the universal, haunts many of these songs, bringing a poignancy that is heightened by KITKA's haunting harmonies. The songs express the range of women's experience, from love and heartbreak, healing, motherhood, a deep connection to nature and spirit, as well as women's particular experience of wartime strife, as in the Bulgarian lament Dor Tri Mi Pushki Pukama:\n\nThree rifles fired, three heroes fell.\nThree heroes fell, three mothers wept.\n\nRecorded at Skywalker Sound, San Rafael, California in March 2001.\n\nKitka: Leslie Bonnett, Shira Cion, Catherine Rose Crowther, Deborah Dietrich, Juliana Graffagna, Janet Kutulas, Ann Moorhead, Lily Storm.\n",

This is one of those albums where we'd definitely recommend purchasing the highest quality audio files (WAVs) over MP3s so that you can really hear all the incredible layering in the arrangments and performances.

Following the release of 2010's Mischief Reigns, and tours around the Northeast and Brazil, the 8-piece outfit have released their much anticipated album, On the Move.\n\nRecorded at New Jersey's Homefront Studio, the album was mixed and mastered at Moresound Studio by the infamous, Jocko. Formally of John Browns Body, Jocko was the soundman entrusted for years with John Brown's Body's signature sound.\n\nWhen asked about the experience Kiwi front man Alex Tea explains \"working with Jocko is really what brought out the sound of the record and made it shine. In addition to being a true wizard in the studio, he's the most warm and humble person, we got some class A hospitality while we were up in Syracuse for the mix.\"\n\nCommenting on the sound of On the Move, Kiwi described the record as expansive with brass-heavy arrangements that echo the classic reggae and RandB of the late 60s and early 70s.\n\nThe new record features influences from Tea's extended stay in Brazil, as Brazilian instruments play a large role in shaping the sound of the record. The group also included an original love song sung entirely in Portuguese called \"Aprendiz\".\n",

Unwritten is the first of pieces in which I transitioned from writing by way of notation into writing through an iteration of improvisation.

    "description": "The guitar is related to the repertoire of the lute and the vihuela as the piano is to the harpsichord or organ. This magical instrument, as Stravinsky said (referring to Andres Segovia's guitar) \"sounds little, but goes far\".\n\nThe guitar has given me the opportunity to immerse myself in the works of great and historical composers such as those recorded in Ancient Mosaic with Guitar. I consider it a privilege to be able to receive through their scores, the sensitivity of such maestros.\n\nThe works of Reusner, Milan, Roncalli, etc, sound good on the modern Spanish guitar, a direct descendant of all those old instruments for which they were written. I just had to play them freely and with respect, feeling them as part of the guitar and without trying to make them sound as anything other than what they intrinsically are. The recording of Ancient Mosaic with Guitar was made several times over the last few years. I never consciously set out to make an album like this, I was simply interested in a particular piece, and so studied and recorded it. Finally, I found I had enough stylistically homogenous material to produce an album.\n\nTwo musical friends participated: the soprano Palmira Irisarri, who sings on tracks 3, 5, 7, 10, 13 and 15, and the percussionist angel Martin, who plays on track 16. My thanks to both of them.\n\nIt was very gratifying for me to work with Palmira Irisarri, an excellent soprano and musicologist. Her singing is distinguished by her sweet, natural timbre and the perfect tuning of her voice. No doubt her style is perfectly suited for these Spanish Renaissance pieces, so often interpreted with later centuries' approaches.\n\nTrack 16, \"Improvisation about Quand voie\", deserves a separate paragraph. It is not an old piece, but is based on a familiar melody in the repertoire of the troubadours \"Quand voie la flor nouvelle\", anonymous. This is a recreation of the original, but with a completely modern interpretation, adding parts of my own composition.\n\nEsteban Canyar\n",

It is a key work early in his 'Heroic' decade (1803-1812) and set the stage for piano compositions in the grand manner both in Beethoven's later work and all future composers.\n\nA bagatelle is a kind of brief character piece. Beethoven meant the six bagatelles to be played in order as a single work, as the keys of the pieces fall in a regular succession of descending major thirds,\n- (the above text is quoted in part from wikipedia)\n\n\"his interpretation is distinguished by a deep intellectual access to the work, an extraordinary nobleness and excellent presentation...perfect technique, tonal well-balanced and fluid play of L.

    "description": "This album sees LehtMoJoe confronting the seemingly difficult challenge of pairing the nostalgic synth-pop from his youth with the more updated polish and electro sheen fans of his music have come to expect.\n\nWhat Leht did with the more club-oriented trait of Justice/Daft Punk/SebastiAn in 2009 he's attempted to do with the wistful sounds of Joe Jackson, Julian Lennon, Phil Collins and Vanity 6 that he first began recording onto cassettes from the radio back in the late 80's. \"Growing up, we were remodeling our house and would frequent Home Depot and Payless Cashways for materials on the weekends, and outside of my brother cutting his finger on a razor blade we found in the store, or picking up the phones in the aisles and making noises into them, it was pretty boring,\" says Leht. \"The one constant that would amuse me however was the song selection that was played in the stores. Hall and Oates, Phil Collins, and Billy Ocean dominated back then. So this is a throwback to that kind of music, sonically interesting with memorable melodies.\"\n\nHelping LehtMoJoe accomplish this task on Aisle 7 were musicians like Max Brown, Sedrick Stylez, Xavier Marquis, and Sara Dean whose distinctive personalities played a large part in shaping the album's characteristic attitude. In short Aisle 7 is full of those rare powerful instances that will one day be remembered, no doubt, as some of the genre's defining moments.\n\n\"I think this album is some of my best work, incorporating techniques from the electronic based music I am very comfortable with, alongside a more traditional approach to songwriting,\" says LehtMoJoe. \"For me, there is a greater feeling of accomplishment creating these kinds of songs. Taking a random lyrical melody in my head and turning it into a complete track is a bit different from my previous album, which is more rhythmically driven.\"\n",

Id become kind of a spectator to my own life, like I'd wake up and do the things that were there to do, and it was eating at me in way I didn't notice until well into my twenties.

    "description": "Although Australia-based singer-songwriter Linda Wood has been compared to Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Rickie Lee Jones, and even a bit of Doris Day, she is a true original with her own style - described, perhaps tongue in cheek, but somewhat accurately, as \"quirk pop.\" In truth, her music is a melting pot of divergent spices and flavors that come together in one of the most unique sonic blends that I've heard in a long time.\n\nThreads of jazz, blues, Latin, hip-hop, techno, pop, and cabaret, create a musical tapestry on which her diverse vocal stylings are embroidered. On the title track an ambient synthesizer sound and slide guitar open the album, providing a brief intro reminiscent of Pink Floyd, which soon dissipates into a groove of bongo drums and a funky hip-hop beat, with subtle flourishes on accordion providing a surrealistic touch. At this point, you know you are in for something out of the ordinary.\n\nThe rest of the album doesn't disappoint. Besides being an extraordinary vocalist, Linda Wood is a talented and imaginative songwriter and storyteller, with her compositions and arrangements enticing the listener through unexpected twists and turns. Choosing a few highlights on the album is difficult, because there are so many worthy choices, and I genuinely loved everything on it. From the Santana-like vibe of \"Goodbye Perfectionist\", to the jazzy Stray Cat Strut jive of \"Get Out Of My Life\" with it's Andrew Sisters style harmonies, to the driving techno tribal beat and middle Eastern-inflected vocals of \"Peter Pan\", there is so much to like. There's also an unlisted bonus song at the end - a poignant ballad about loss and healing.\n\nOne of the most quirky, yet endearing songs is \"Bittersweet,\" a psychedelic carnival ride of a tune, complete with yodeling, triangle, and tuba that would not have been out of place on an early Frank Zappa record or Fellini soundtrack. While there are some offbeat combinations of instruments and elements on the album, they are artfully integrated and add textures that put a stamp of originality on the music. But it is clearly the vocal talent of Linda Wood that is the shining star here and illuminates an emotional gamut from sassy and sultry to longing and vulnerable. She is seemingly capable of handling any style with ease and grace, as well as having done an outstanding job of multi-tracking background vocals and harmonies in interesting ways.\n\n\"Duel\" is a very professional sounding and extremely well produced CD with a lot of obvious attention to detail in the musical production as well as in the album's artwork, which has a bit of a Stevie Nicks ambience. Some of the arrangements are intricate yet accessible. The deeply expressive and artistic nature of \"Duel\" is no surprise considering Linda's extensive background in musical theatre, having been involved in productions in Australia, England, and New York. This album reveals an impressive talent with great potential, and one that will, I'm sure, develop a loyal following as listeners discover the genre blending alchemy of Linda Wood's music.\nMichael Diamond - ReviewYou.com\n",

All of it is tied together with Wood's strong, pop sensible voice and stellar musical performances from her backing musicians. The subtle and unusual addition is, of course, a ukulele. Rather than colouring the entire album it is blended beautifully into the instrumentation in a way that represents the ukulele-wielding songtress' style very well. The gentle upbeat feel of the album is definitely easy listening.\n\nAn honest album that is both nostalgic and fresh, Return is, for the most part, a reminiscence about the choices Wood has made that have in turn made her. These reminiscences are personal and universal, such as a first kiss, body image struggles, love hoped for, loneliness, and frustration in relationship.\n",

To draw comparisons to other bands, I can't help but think of The Clash and their radio hit \"Rock the Casbah.\" You can expect to hear the pure spirit of classic hardcore punk (not this modern Green Day stuff) with just enough pop mixed in to make it accessible to casual listeners without selling out.

This is the music of the ForeignLander.\n\nLydia McCauley documented folk music at the Appalachian Music Archive in Berea, Kentucky in the early 1980's and studied with some of the best folk musicians in the Appalachian region. Known today as a songwriter, McCauley returns to her roots in her fifth album, ForeignLander; a collection of innovatively arranged pieces from 17-20th Century British Isles and Appalachia, beautifully performed by McCauley and her Ensemble, along with special guests. While careful to preserve Appalachian traditions, Lydia creates a fresh sound that pleases both traditional and progressive music audiences. Includes an original instrumental - \"Swallow's Return\" composed by McCauley.\n\n\"Laced with medieval, Celtic, and Appalachian tones, her songs are best described as intoxicating, making a lissome journey through the past via the textured sounds of the ensemble's recorders, flutes, viola, pennywhistle, and mandolin. Beyond musical technique, McCauley's lyrics betray a poet's sensibility, good enough to earn Madeleine L'Engle's glowing praise: \"I wouldn't have missed this for anything. The words were must as good as the music.\"\n-Luci Shaw, Image Journal\n\n\"Music for independent minds that are looking for something refreshingly different.\"\n-Chuck Robinson, President, American Bookseller's Association\n\n\"Lyrical magic that will uplift the spirits...exceptional instrumental tracks that will haunt your mind and transport you back in time...\"\n-Nicky Rossiter, South East Radio, Ireland\n\n\"A well known artist in the Celtic and New Age worlds, this album takes a slight detour as Lydia McCauley takes traditional Appalachian melodies and works her magic on them. The simplicity of the songs makes them a perfect fit for Lydia's style. Adding classical, jazz, Celtic and world music elements to these tracks gives them new life and new passion, which Lydia hopes will help them travel a little further and be passed down once again.\"\n-Goldenrod Music\n",

It's a wonderful addition to winter holiday collections, expanding the usual Christmas faire into pieces from medieval Italy, France, Scotland and England. \"Bring Us In Good Ale\" includes vocals by The Blessed Lady's Pub Chorus and ends with peals of laughter.\n\nThe cover art and text portray its spiritual and traditional origins and in many ways add to the overall experience. The tunes and songs here are derived from many sources and times and yet they combine old and new compositions. The title track has music from France, lyrics dating from around 1643 with an English translation in 1926 and an adaptation in 2002 by McCauley.\n\nFrom this mixture she has produced lyrical magic that will uplift the spirits. On \"Gifts of the Magi,\" she takes full control, writing and arranging. The result is a 21st century song that would not have raised eyebrows in medieval courts. \"Good King Wenceslas\" and the former track make this an ideal Christmas album if one is looking for traditional with a twist, but this is an all-year-round album so don't restrict your enjoyment to two weeks a year.\n\nOn hearing McCauley sing this song so sadly seen only as a carol, you must recognise it as a classic of good composition. The music may date from 1582 but this is 2003 sound.\"Childgrove\" and \"Ideo Gloria\" are two exceptional instrumental tracks that will haunt your mind and transport you back in time to a glorious age of madrigal and courtly love. McCauley takes an Appalachian song, \"Down in Yon Forest,\" and gives it an interpretation that is probably closer to the original tune that traveled to the U.S. There is a very special bonus on this track. McCauley sings her version of the song, which is followed immediately by an arrangement by Brian Cunningham. This shows how an old song can be interpreted to give two or more distinct songs. Listen only to this track and marvel.\n",

Galliarda's version is an instrumental and lively renaissance version, which Stephane Potvin's version is choral.\n\nb) Ralph Rousseau Meulenbroeks playing popular Christmas tunes on the baroque viola da gamba.\n\nc) Harper's Hamper doing a solo operatic \"What Child is This\", as well as what sounds like a group of drunk Victorian Brits meeting a folk band in a dark alley, doing their version of \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nd) And speaking of \"Jingle Bells\", no Christmas would be complete without Anup's Indian/Electronica fusion version of that song.\n\ne) An electro/Chinese version of \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\".\n\nf) A lyrically revised version of \"Wassail\", capturing what our homeless might want for their Christmas meal.\n\ng) and many other interesting, sparkly treats!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nfrom John Buckman, Magnatune's founder/gardener/janitor\n",

Then if you're very lucky, as quickly as the left, they reappear, like a phoenix from the ashes, reformed (well, kind of) as a new incarnation - MAKO. MAKO are good. Really good, and the new album is a showcase of everything that 'Makos' these guys great (like what I did there?)...Brimmed with shimmering guitars and addictive hooks, the triumphant return of one of the best bands, albeit in a slightly different format, that the UK has seen for a long time\".\nReview by: Gray Thomas.\"DSD\"\n",

A homage to his family's nomadic journey around the world.\n\nA word from Maneli Jamal:\n\"This concept album is dedicated to my family's nomadic journey around the world. I tried my best to capture our journey through music, to take you, the listener, where I once stood, to feel what I lived. As hard as it was at times on our travels, we learned a great deal in the process. I know I wouldn't be able to express myself with the guitar the way I do, if it weren't for these experiences I encountered as a youth. But in retrospect, all six family members agree that where we are now is a much better place.\n\nI hope you enjoy these compositions and are inspired to reflect on your own history, rediscovering the treasurable stories that lie there.\"\n",

All other instruments were played by Boulle and it is also worth noting that he is credited too with the engineering and production of the album.\n\n\"Boulle has a natural talent for songwriting that manages to sidestep all the tired cliches to give personal and personable reflections on the world around him...He comes across as a relaxed and likable host who is keen to enjoy life but suspicious of superficial pleasures. If there was any justice in the world it is a record that would earn his fortune.

This album is a beguilingly bittersweet mixture of optimism and poignancy. 12 tracks comprise this Folk Acoustic-based release starting with the punchy I Miss You and finishing with the dreamy wandering of I See You I Need You.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are both personal and evocative, full of imagery, and painting pictures and telling stories in a way in which you get to fill in the gaps in your own mind. The themes that stand out are love, travel, substance addiction, the search for contentment, and the appreciation of the simple beauty of life. Mark explores these themes through songwriting that is, like his voice, completely unpretentious and easily accessible. His band of Haba Dudes sound great on this album from Elodie Mayberry on violin through to the percussive wonders of Keith Stephens on drums.\n",

It is a Folk Roots album of political and social importance with the title track and Whale Reggae leading the way. The album showcases Mark's band Haba Dudes and has contributions from Elodie Mayberry on violin, J Harding Clark on drums and Neil Macleod on flute and clarinet among others.\n\nThis album was recorded and engineered by Mark at various studios around South East Queensland and his home on the Gold Coast. It is as a testament to his skills also as an engineer and producer that this album shines. Mixed with J Harding Clark and mastered by Matthew Gray the album has a lovely soft, almost analogue sound to it, which will surely stand the tests of time. While the album has a political theme, uplifting love songs provide a balance and give more insight into the depths of this unique songwriter. This is a gem of an album and- don't let the title fool you- great for children to sing and dance along too as well! Deserves repeated spins.\n",

    "description": "\"Take from the rich\", the new album from Mark Boulle and the Haba Dudes, combines the best of what it means to be Australian, with the best of Mark and the band's unassuming personalities and musical style, with the best of Gypsy and Folk music, for a listening experience that is smooth, thoroughly enjoyable, and that very importantly bears repetition. This is the music of goodwill and harmony; it is relaxed and soothing, with its soothing quality reaching a peak in the song, \"Story of a Cake\", where the lyrics promise gently, \"It'll make you feel good\"... and it does.\n\nThis is an album for those who appreciate fine introspective acoustic-based music with depth of feeling. Mark and the band have crafted fourteen inspirational acoustic-based songs that take the listener on a journey of heart, soul and conscience through a rich emotional and personal landscape, reminding us that in an imperfect world, the possibility to transcend our problems through appreciation is ever-present. Daren Williams on bass and Matthew Brown on drums and percussion provide solid, respectable and unobtrusive rhythmic backing, restrained from unnecessary (and inappropriate) complexity, in keeping with the simple, down-to-earth style of this music. Elodie Mayberry plays the violin with wonderful feeling, subtlety and depth, and she adds a whole other dimension to this album. Neil Macleod's flute and clarinet contributions are beautifully textured and resonant, and Steve Keyse on saxophone and keys injects with skill his soul and passion into the mix.\n\nOne of the finest songs on the album is \"Suga Mama\": with a soulful, almost haunting melody, the lyrics give us a strong sense of Mark's authenticity, honesty and playfulness. \"Greenside\" is another one of the highlights of the album: a subtle meandering song featuring moaning violin and soulful sax, it is also the most political song of the album aside from the title track, gently pointing to problematic behaviours in the world without being pushy or self-righteous about it.\n",

We have Italian or Spanish music composed for this instrument between the late 17th century and the beginning of 18th.\n\nThe baroque lute had a new tuning developed by the school of French lutenists, which was adopted by Germany, Flanders and the Eastern European countries in particular. The influence of the French court of Louis XIV on northern part of Europe is undisputed. The French school of lutenists were traveling through the courts and salons of Europe, publishing material and giving concerts. Their advice was sought throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, Italy and Spain were not interested in the this new tuning of the lute, they kept their older tunings, which lead them to the violin, the opera orchestra and singing.\n\nItaly in turn influenced European music at the beginning of the 18th century with the opera concerto, arias of divas and castrati and impresarios.\n\nThe music of the lute, has a massive and rich past and came to maturity during this time both in terms of the music and instrument building (\"lutherie\"), this in turn caused a great interest in the lute from interpreters, composers and the public.\n\nThe popularity of the lute is visible in the repertoire: solos, chamber music, and lute concertos start to appear and the virtuosity and genius of the interpretations are at their historical peak during this period.\n\nIt is in this environment that the different styles and tastes reunite and create a new fashion which comes to be known as the \"galant style\" of lute playing.\n",

Known throughout Europe, envied by musicians, he has composed over 600 pieces for lute, without counting the many works lost or \"destroyed\" and according to the legend, those works \"not to be copied and kept secret\".\n\nSurrounded by a fantastic troupe of musicians at the court of Dresden, his meeting and friendship with JS Bach and participation with the Collegium Musicum, his various sojourns in Italy, his knowledge of the music of his time made him an accomplished composer. The influences of Italian opera, concertos, sonatas for violin, knowledge of French music on the lute, the operas of Lully culminated in him being the musical worthy of the great Bach. The meeting of French taste and rhythms, Italian Cantabiles and dazzling German form with its highly developed phrasing is obvious when you listen, play or analyze his work.\n",

    "description": "Glittering narratives: songs that spring up wildly from her subconscious and bloom into vibrant, lilting melodies. Her sparkling piano refrains sweep and spill into fresh, sweet rivulets of notes; her lyrics weave bright, halcyon tales of dream sequences, the light and dark polarities of the human experience, and beauty in its many forms.\n\nSometimes at night fireflies light up; and so we catch them and put them in a jar. Living beings they are, and lamps they become until they burn out and die. They serve one purpose--to entertain. A song holds within itself a certain power of the same measure. When it is created, it holds captive the thoughts and ideas, emotions and inner turmoil of its creator...over time the song grows and evolves, and though it may mean different things to different people, its final end is to give the listener pleasure. And so, here you are - my jar of fireflies.\n\n\"Invisible War\" is my first jar...a collection of some of the first fireflies I ever caught; mostly they were just sprouting their wings in that time, learning all about life, exploring the world, and frolicking about with me in fascinating places like Mongolia, where I lived until I was eight. Really I caught the first specimen in this particular jar when I was fifteen - \"Song of the Open Road\" - based on the Whitman poem of the same name.\n\nNow, at 21, I'm always chasing around a few fireflies at a time, attempting to master the art of capturing the most elaborate creatures. The idea is that the better the creature, the longer it will stay alive and the brighter its light will shine. We need bright light, see, because it's dark sometimes, very dark.\n\nI have dreams about how the world should be. Indeed we live in a place which was meant to be beautiful; though we oftentimes ruin it ourselves by default. In science there is the idea of entropy - the tendency of things toward disorder. If a vase is sitting on a little table, it's quite probable that it could fall off and shatter into a hundred pieces, if not rather unlikely that all those pieces would jump back together again and shape themselves once again into a beautiful vase--unless of course someone worked very hard to glue it all back together into something new and different.\n\nUnfortunately the implications of this in real life are much more complicated than a single vase shattering to the ground. We see natural disasters that destroy and reshape lives; wars, rumors of wars that create tension and dissension between people groups; poverty, disease, starvation, and everything that lies between.\n\nThese are the things which burden my heart, and the things which I've always felt compelled to express through my music. If all I do in life is shine a little light into the dark spaces of the world, my time on earth will certainly not have been wasted.\n\nSo I catch fireflies.\n\nHere's a short quote about Invisible War - \"Merry Ellen's CD is excellent. I like the single \"Blinding Me\" the best. It fits her voice and style of delivery to great effect I think?\"\n- Mark Isham, Grammy, Emmy, and Clio Award Winning Film Score Composer (Crash, October Sky, Fly Away Home, Of Mice and Men)\n",

    "description": "A folk artist, but with a pop heart. And a Zen-like sense of warmth and wonder that imbues his subtle, yet crafty, material.' Miles of Music (2006)\n\nMichael Joy hails from the East Coast, where he fronted a few groups before migrating to the West. He's settled in Berkeley, a suitable spot for his easy mannered Americana, which is enriched with a glow of '70s era singer/songwriter charm. He is, at the core, a folk artist, but with a pop heart. And a Zen-like sense of warmth and wonder that imbues his subtle, yet crafty, material. Emmy nominated songwriter/producer Benjamin Birkbeck describes his songs and sounds as \"a mix of Dylan, Traveling Wilburys, Beatles, Cowboy Junkies with a modern alternative western rock edge.\" (Rivulet Music)(Miles Of Music Review August 05)\n\nMichael Joy's \"River Of Days\" comes out of nowhere with a startling and very beautiful collection of pop, folk, and Americana songs. Remarkable for its consistency of pure songwriting, track after track one feels in the presence of a sure hand of lyric and melody. \"Bakersfield\"from \"River Of Days\" is one of the five finalists in the 2005 Independent Music Awards. Produced by Benji Farquhar who's worked with Taj Mahal, and also has worked with Grammy Award engineer Michael Rosen.Mixed by Justin Phelps, known for his work with Chuck Prophet, Cake and other independent artists, and mastered by veteran producer/ engineer John Cuniberti at The Plant, \"River Of Days\" is the first full studio album by this northern California musician.\n\nThese eleven songs are as catchy as hell! Fine laid back guitar lines and a beautiful groomed arrangement of each song.... Stand out songs are \"Night Flight Over Water\", \"Bakersfield\", \"Mark Twain\", and \"Better Men Than You\". This subtle album, with certainly commercial (positively meant) aspirations has much to offer. Considering the potency of the songwriting, I expect in the future Michael Joy will find himself being courted by numerous record labels. Meanwhile, there's much here to enjoy on this excellent album, \"River Of Days\"\nAug 05 review in Alt-Country (Netherlands)\n",

    "description": "Michael Tiernan's 4th studio album LA Can Wait is Coldplay meets Jack Johnson, Kerouac meets Confucius. It's an album for both the goal-driven workaholic and the free-spirited contemplative. It takes you from the beach to the city, from the temple to the tavern, and leaves a little bit of your heart in each place.\n\nBut still the question is - Why can L.A. wait? Mostly because of a few phone calls Tiernan has received the past couple of years. One went like this: \"Don't worry Mike, I am Strong\". Tiernan hung up the phone and couldn't believe it. Stage 4 cancer, his own brother. 2 years later, as Tiernan was recording tracks in the studio for \"Strong\", the very song he had written about his brother Joe's battle with the terrible disease, he received another call, this time from the hospital. Joe was passing away. Tiernan played the song for his brother on the last morning of his life. That song, \"Strong\", is the swirling center of Michael's emotional and inspiring new album, \"LA Can Wait\".\n\nYet \"LA Can Wait\" is not about death, and is certainly not a downer. \"LA Can Wait\" is actually an incredibly celebratory album that reveres each unique color in the spectrum of life, from birth to death, with the over-arching mandate to appreciate and enjoy every moment in between, as the album's laid back last track, the flip-flop wearing beachy anthem, \"Easy\", proclaims.\n\nIn fact, a cancer-survivor himself, Tiernan penned two of the most tender of love songs, \"LA Can Wait\" and \"Father and Child\", inspired by a couple other calls he got - the ones where his wife said, \"I'm pregnant\". Having been a year away from being ordained a Catholic priest in Rome just several years before, kids were never in the picture. But life changes in an instant, and this new set of Tiernan's tunes are feel-good and sometimes tear-jerking reflections about all the amazing twists of life, especially the unexpected ones.\n",

By age 11 he had branched out into woodwinds, playing alto sax in the school orchestra until the fateful day in 1977 when his family moved to Germany and he was forced to leave the saxophone behind.\n\nLuckily, this did not spell the end of his career - upon arriving in Germany, he promptly put his talents to good use on a Gibson western guitar, expanding his repertoire with lessons and collaborations with Thomas Reuther, who went on to become a noted classical guitarist in his own right.\n\nThe two went on to eventually form the Turkish/Oriental fusion band 'Grup Fakir', with several other musicians, and received critical acclaim and an offer to tour Turkey in the mid-1990's. Unfortunately the band dissolved shortly after recording their first demo cd, but Thomas and Michel continued their forays, delving into musical motifs that firmly straddled Greek and Turkish origins.\n\nIn 1995 Michel met new cohorts, Christian Wolff and Michael Fey, who he went on to produce and perform live soundscapes and themes to Fachhochschule - Frankfurt theatres production of Shakespeares' 'Midsummer Nights Dream' and 'Macbeth'. Again, his efforts met with resounding success, both personally and publicly.\n\nMichel and Christian went on to form the experimental acoustic/electro-fusion/jazz/techno/blues-rock band 'Ultraschall', playing on a weekly basis with guest artists from around the world, including Christian Schmidhofer of Embryo.\n\nIn 1999, Jordan and Fey teamed up, under the Sensor II moniker, to produce some new tracks with a more electronic edge, cuts of which rose to the top of the charts on Garageband.com and were included on the Garageband 'Best of Electronica' compilation CD. It was through Garageband that Artemis connected with Jordan to eventually produce the track 'Hypno' on Artemis' latest release 'Gravity'.\n\n'Fata Morgana' is Jordan's latest effort, a sensual trip that beats a path across time and genre, melding the past, present and future sounds of world music.\n",

    "description": "The music of Passage emerged from working in conjunction with massage therapists, with the specific intent of incorporating the healing power of sound and music to provide a total relaxation experience for the listener.\n\nPassage is a wonderful mix of acoustic and electronic instruments, including: acoustic and electric guitars, Native American flutes, Tibetan and crystal singing bowls, various chimes and bells, synthesizers and samplers. Prepare for your journey.\n\nPASSAGE is 62 minutes, symbolic of a journey within a journey. You may listen in any order, but this is how the journey proceeds for me:\n\nDAWN OF LIGHT: A perfect day starts with a perfect Dawn... new beginnings with the first step, a heart open to transformation. Dawn of Light invites us to stop, breathe, and let our breath's rhythm match the flow of the soundscape. Prepare for the journey within.\n\nPOINT LOBOS: Spend the day on the rich, diverse coastline of Point Lobos, near Monterey, California. Natural cadences of wind, surf and ocean air, with sea birds, harbor seals, otters, and distant humpbacks, create a deep calm, offering boundless space for inspiration and hope. The ocean washes away our stress, and heals.\n\nIN THE NOW: Journey deeply into the present as chimes and a Tibetan singing bowl erase time. Each breath in ? out cleanses and renews us.\n\nINNER PEACE: End with the Beginning. The genesis of this, the first piece composed for Passage, was the Winter Solstice of 2005. With the first brush strokes during the shortest days of the year, it gives thanks and optimistically looks to spring's rising Light.\n\nFollow your Heart. Dream. Create. Realize Transformation.\n\nPeace to you on your Journey,\nMike Wall\n",

They weren't worried about polishing every note as long as they captured the emotion and energy of the song. This album does that by being a product of what can happen when you record a band \"live\" in the studio. Tracks weren't recorded one at a time, but together with all the members playing at the same time. Just like the great bands of yesterday did it. Mojo Radio feels this produces a more organic and original result.\n\nThe songs on the self titled album are varied. The album kicks off with a blues based harmonica instrumental (WELCOME), but soon leads to catchy up beat rocker (HIGH HORSE). There are heavy tracks like THROW YOUR HAT IN THE RING, and also slower songs like DREAMING. All of these center around the blues influences and rock legends of the 1970s. Mojo Radio's goal was to make an album influenced by the past but right up to date.\n",

    "description": "Recorded in an out-of-use orphanage in the mountains of Guatemala, Mountain Sounds is an entirely self-produced, indie-in-the-truest-sense-of-the-word recording project comprised of two friends coming together from separate parts of the world to realize a shared vision of rock and roll music.\n\nThe album is a testament not only to the importance and scarcity of true creative chemistry, but also to the need to make art regardless of the obstacles in the way. All of us were born to create; it's as natural as breath, as necessary as food, and comforting as sleep. We grew up drawing pictures, singing songs, staging plays - but we kept growing, and we found ourselves working in banks, managing retail shops, selling insurance. The only singing we do now is in cars piddling along in rush hour traffic.\n\n'Mountain Sounds' is a step away from what we've become and back towards who we were. Six years removed from their last collaborative recording project, Portland, Oregon's Tim Hoyt and Guatemala's own Franc Castillejos came together to make something vital and new in the only place they could: a vacant orphanage in the mountains of Central America.\n\nFormer band mates separated for years by arbitrary ideas like nationalities, immigration laws, and time zones (not to mention several thousand very real miles), Hoyt and Castillejos found themselves discouraged and sputtering after years apart; drifting ever farther from the life they loved, ever closer to a life neither of them wanted. On the verge of acquiescence, they chose instead something altogether different: a last-ditch attempt to be who they used to be.\n\nAfter a summer spent recording and trading demos separately, Tim quit his insurance job and left his home in Portland, Oregon, relocating to Franc's family's property on a secluded patch of land in the Cordillera Alux mountain range west of Guatemala City. The two set up shop in an old, out-of-use orphanage on the grounds, transforming the space into a functioning studio using what limited resources they could find.\n\nFor three months they lived and breathed nothing but their music, taking breaks only for meals, even sleeping in the makeshift studio. The long, cold rainy season ensured that they spent almost every waking moment in that space, working without interruption. Their seclusion provided extraordinary focus; their extreme limitations, an opportunity to try everything differently.\n\nAfter three months, they emerged with twelve songs that showcased their distinct voice; songwriting defined by complex catchiness, minor chord melancholy, and sparse, deliberate arrangements. Franc's lyrics embody his unique perspective as a man caught in the middle, a Guatemalan who spent a decade in America, who thinks in Spanish but writes in English, who loves his home and his country but longs for his friends in a land he's not permitted to visit.\n\nNothing about 'Mountain Sounds' was easy or without risk. Nothing was normal: not where it was made, or how. Not how its creators reunited after years apart, putting their entire lives on hold to pursue something they hadn't done together in ages. But concepts like \"easy,\" \"safe,\" and \"normal\" don't matter very much when you're doing what you were born to do. And with 'Mountain Sounds,' Franc and Tim are finally back where they always should have been.\n",

Six years removed from their last collaborative recording project, Portland, Oregon's Tim Hoyt and Guatemala's own Franc Castillejos came together to make something vital and new in the only place they could: a vacant orphanage in the mountains of Central America.\n\nFormer band mates separated for years by arbitrary ideas like nationalities, immigration laws, and time zones (not to mention several thousand very real miles), Hoyt and Castillejos found themselves discouraged and sputtering after years apart; drifting ever farther from the life they loved, ever closer to a life neither of them wanted. On the verge of acquiescence, they chose instead something altogether different: a last-ditch attempt to be who they used to be.\n\nAfter a summer spent recording and trading demos separately, Tim quit his insurance job and left his home in Portland, Oregon, relocating to Franc's family's property on a secluded patch of land in the Cordillera Alux mountain range west of Guatemala City. The two set up shop in an old, out-of-use orphanage on the grounds, transforming the space into a functioning studio using what limited resources they could find.\n\nFor three months they lived and breathed nothing but their music, taking breaks only for meals, even sleeping in the makeshift studio. The long, cold rainy season ensured that they spent almost every waking moment in that space, working without interruption. Their seclusion provided extraordinary focus; their extreme limitations, an opportunity to try everything differently.\n\nAfter three months, they emerged with twelve songs that showcased their distinct voice; songwriting defined by complex catchiness, minor chord melancholy, and sparse, deliberate arrangements.\n\nNothing about 'Mountain Sounds' was easy or without risk. Nothing was normal: not where it was made, or how. Not how its creators reunited after years apart, putting their entire lives on hold to pursue something they hadn't done together in ages. But concepts like \"easy,\" \"safe,\" and \"normal\" don't matter very much when you're doing what you were born to do. And with 'Mountain Sounds,' Franc and Tim are finally back where they always should have been.\n",

Highly literate beats, sampling, and turntablism blend with whispery, jazz inflected melodies to form an atmospheric, sultry album of huge appeal. Epic has a way with sonic textures that give his work a lot of character and soul, and he's also quite obviously a master of mood -favoring urbane, nocturnal soundscapes laced with muted trumpets, smoky beats, and echoing water droplets. It's electric, eclectic noir at it's finest.\n",

    "description": "5 Years had passed since an MRDC release. I had been working on and off on a new album idea for 3 years after a 2 year break. I was busy writing for Television as one of the songwriters for the hit show \"Ghost Whisper\" and felt I had returned to my roots that started me out with \"Timecode\" reusing ideas and tracks as I went along recording album #3. I wanted to call it \"Living Rooms\" and the idea was an album of songs you'd listen to in your living space. Much more groove orientated laid back kinda vibes. I also wanted to play more guitar this time.\n\nAs time went on we were past the middle of the \"Bush Years\" and I became fascinated by all the conspiracy theories and videos on You Tube. Living up North in Canada being on the outside looking in there was quite allot to get caught up in. It seemed as though the movie \"Wag the Dog\" was coming to life and I thought well if John Mayer's lyrics \"And when you trust your television what you get is what you got, cause when they own the information, oh they can bend it all they want\" are on the radio after all the political songs before \"Waiting on the World to Change\" maybe musicians can still use the power of music to tell the people what's really going on. So I came up with the Idea to call my project \"Infomusication\" that stands for information and education delivered by music.\n\nThe tone of the album changed and the idea for \"Living Rooms\" was kinda dropped although some of the tracks are still there. I used public domain recordings of JFK speeches because when I listened to what he was saying it amazed me that nothing has really changed since he spoke. Most of the snippets I used are from mixed speeches to reorganize the message into the song, but the things he was talking about are unchanged. As with my first 2 albums I write, play, record, program all the tracks. A true solo effort with more guitar, bigger bass ? real drums mixed with all the things I had learned while dabbling in \"Electronica\" left me wondering \"What the heck do I call this?\" I never really felt that MRDC fit in any one genre before. I had said that my music was more like a sound painting on an electronic canvas. I never considered myself an Electronic or Electronica artist and neither did the purists. So I've come up with my own genre and I call it \"Synthetic\". To me this refers to music created independently with the use of a computer as the \"Hub\". It is created by someone that plays or programs all the instruments creating a Hybrid or \"Synthetic\" type of music that sounds as though it was made by a performing group of musicians and a producer using modern techniques to add to the sound. But its just one guy having fun. Hope you enjoy it and I invite anyone like me that makes music this way to join me and call their music \"Synthetic too.\n",

On the track \"Angel\" I used singing software mixed with pre recorded vocal samples. \"Holly\" is my daughter and I kind of ended up finishing the track for her, she was just 2 at the time and the center of my world. Some of the tracks go as fast as 140bpm. Some of the experimental things I played with were morphing sounds from track to track with filters and other things to make the tracks grow and move between real instruments and synthetic. I got carried away and actually had about 5 more tracks I intended to put on it but eventually you just have to say \"DONE\" and I released 10 tracks as on my first album.\n",

My friends had heard some of the things I was working on and suggested I release an album of songs and put them on the Internet. So I started remixing and restructuring the tracks I liked. When I was finished I presented my album ideas to a few friends via mp3.com and it kinda took off from there. A couple years later I stumbled on Magnatune and with the opportunity to change a couple things that bugged me I officially released Timecode with its new cover art and remix and fix of a few tracks. With Timecode and my subsequent releases my approach has always been \"Whatever Works\" I'm not a vocalist or lyricist so I use and edit samples to say the things I want that I can't with just the music tracks. I play or program all the instruments and tracks always.\n",

The wild improvisatory violin sonatas of the 1660's used richly colorful and dissonant harmonies and an unrestricted form, which allowed for an extremely wide range of expressive possibilities and experimentation that sound strange to our ears today. Throughout the 1700's, the sonata gradually morphed and crystallized into the symmetrical form exemplified by Handel, Corelli and Vivaldi, who created the first harmonic and structural expectations which still govern our responses today.\n",

The history of the polyphonic wheel lyre stetches back for about a thousand years - and thus, in this music live medieval castles and roving musicians, and the air is clean, which is so lacking in our modern cities.\n\nNot every player is able to breathe life into old instruments, let them sound bright, deeply, to sparkle and sing. Olexa Kabanov though is undoubtedly capable. He plays traditional tunes that sound as if they have not been played for hundreds of years but they are alive, close, and warm. There is such a feeling as if the melody and you yourself have gone beyond the confines of this time - and no one is getting older, nothing disappears, while the music pulls you back.\n\nThe polyphonic wheel lyre played by Olexa Kabanov has become versatile orchaestral instrument- really enriched. I think you will appreciate the depth of her voice, the grace of shades - and want to know more...\"\n",

    "description": "\"One Sock Thief'\"s debut album Tell Them Now is replete with probing lyrics and orchestral flourishes, it has drawn comparisons to records from bands as varied as Keane, Depeche Mode, and Genesis.\n\nLyrically and musically, the album examines the balance between chaos and order, both personally and externally.\n\nThe tone for the album is set by, Neverland- a massive piano driven ode to youth and the unknown. It's straight rhythms juxtapose exquisitely with its flowing melodic lines and it is the most indicative of the sound of One Sock Thief.\n\nPeople was released as a single in the same year that the album was released. Unlike the rest of their freshman offering, People was intended to be more of a dance number, introduced into their set-list to compete with the party-like atmosphere created by their companion touring bands. The rest of the sound on Tell Them Now is however, more of a listener's medium, than a dancer's delight.\n\nWires offers yet another perspective to the Thief's sonic palette and introduces finger picked guitars, a brass section and lighter percussion.\n\nConsisting of a guitar-driven chorus, and the self-realizing refrain \"you gotta know yourself,\" Shaker would prove to be the Thief's most successful track, eventually charting at number 2 on the MK (a South African music video channel) Top 10 countdown.\n\nMan of Hope is a syncopated rock song that speaks to the madness of everyday life. It alternates between a bouncing verse and a familiar piano-laden chorus, before eventually diving into a double timed outro.\n\nSpin is a slow tempo love dirge that is set apart by the relative absence of flowing piano lines, favoring instead a softly strummed guitar.\n\nHoney is one of Tell Them Now's darker moments. Echoing the discordant flight patterns of bees, it is set in 5/4 meter. Lyrically, it moves along themes of alienation in the verse, before disintegrating into a flurry of melodic mayhem in the chorus and finally releasing into the relatively tranquil buzzing of bees in the outro.\n\nFootsteps of the Angel is One Sock Thief's take on a traditional rock song, and adds a swinging groove to the their typical sound. Once again the band manages to take a relatively ordinary musical concept, inject it with unique textures, and turn it into something extraordinary.\n\nCatastrophism offers a heaven's-eye view of earth's shifting tectonic plates, and conjures images of the chaos that is necessary to create continents. The music follows an appropriately grandiose scale and is the only song to fade out, hinting at the continuing cycle of life.\n\nSunday Afternoons is a perfect pop song, that reflects on carefree summer afternoons.\n\nTell Them Now, the track for which the album is named, is about rebirth and uses the metaphor of fire to explain destruction and new life. It makes use of an e-bow and percussion to create a different variation on the sparseness that is thematic throughout the album.\n",

    "description": "A Different Story, Ensemble Panic's second album, contains the elements of magic and heavenly witchery that were present in their debut album, and simultaneously carries a new spirit - a strong connection to the earth, which is expressed in the fresh and colorful electric sound.\n\nThe music is driven by a rhythm section of drums, bass and electric guitar, orchestrated together with viola, accordion, piano and trumpet, creating a mixture of folk rock pop and cabaret music. The song lyrics were written by poet Karen Alkalay Gut, and deal with life conflicts, relationships, and humanity.\n\nTo deepen Panic Ensemble's new sound dimension Roy Yarkoni added Avi Belleli (Tractor's Revenge) and they produced the album. The mix smoothly completing Panic Ensemble's weave of celestial vs. corporal, was made by Richard Woodcraft, who won a Grammy for his work with Radiohead and who has worked over the years with Arctic Monkeys, Neil Young, Robbie Williams and others)in the Flexi Sound Studios in London.\n",

Songs are played by excellent musicians from the Italian jazz scene.\n\nThe compositions are a set of ideas inspired by the repertoire of old and new American Jazz school, expanding the boundaries to reach a very personal and intimate musical discourse.\n\nThe theme of the album is improvisation. The musicians have interpreted and developed the original ideas while maintaining a good interplay, giving the work a feel of a live performance.\n\nThe album contains songs from the more classic taste, like the ballad Silent, Urban Slanging or Blue Night Dance. There are also songs more intimate and experimental, like What's Up that presents a musical structure typical of the so-called modal jazz of Miles Davis. Opposites presents, instead, a ring-form, leaving improvisation greater creative freedom. Finally there are more modern pieces such as Looking For A Way Out and Third that go more toward a landscape of musical fusion of jazz, funky grooves and Urban Jazz.\n",

Saint Justin the Martyr cites the text of the hymn around 150 in his dialogue with Trypho. The \"Lamp-lighting hymn\" was described by Saint Basil around the year 365 as a hymn used centuries before him. Saint Athenogenes and ten disciples sang the Phos Hilaron in joy amidst the flames of martyrdom at Sebaste under the Emperor Diocletian in the year 305.\n\nAlthough it pre-dated the Byzantium, it is referred to as \"Byzantine\" since the hymn was used in the Byzantine vespers liturgy. It is clearly Greek in its musical form and composition while it has a text that is Jewish in origin and conforms to the Jewish calendar in which the day ends and begins at sunset.\n\nPhos Hilaron is still sung in Greek Orthodox churches. It did not become part of the Western tradition until around 1700 and is now included in the Anglican Hymnal. The earliest English translation was made in 1675. Translations following the line scheme of the original Greek were made by John Keble in 1834 and by Robert Bridges, poet laureate of England, in 1890.\n\nThe version on this album is from the 1982 Hymnal of the Episcopal Church.\n",

Endlessly we are filled, openings to the S K Y o f G R A C E...\n\nReviews\nThis new music drifts higher into a universe of ethereal sound-clouds, rather than the sunlit Mediterranean of the earlier album. Even when Sky of Grace has rhythm and percussion, it remains all contemplative, filled with a mood of mystical reverie. Avgerinos shows his competence as a composer and arranger on this album. He is a master of sound textures, especially with strings. He has some of the best people in the field playing for him : David Darling on cello and Brian Keane on guitars. Avgerinos himself plays both the bowed string bass and the electric fretless bass; his playing of these unforgiving instruments is so expressive that it sounds almost like a singing voice. Avgerinos' jazz harmonies, slowed down to an ambient pace, are very much his own - his style is easily recognizable. He also uses a sighing, crooning \"choir\" of electronically multiplied voices, who sing in better tune than any real human choir - a chorus of cyber-angels perhaps. These guide us through many tracks filled with sensuous languor and mystical yearning, such as the opening \"Angel Breath\" or \"Graceful\", later in the album. On other tracks such as \"The Calling\" or \"Dance of Life\", slow percussion and distant-reverbed guitar notes add a slightly harder quality. Track 8, \"My Father's Prayer\", is an imaginative interpretation of the sound and mood of Byzantine chant (Avgerinos is of Greek descent, thus his father would probably have prayed Eastern Orthodox prayers) in which the cyber-chorus keeps on low, repeated chant notes without singing identifiable Greek words or Byzantine melodies. It's a moving, serious piece, coming in the midst of an album which can honestly be called \"New Age\".\n\nThis album is a joy to listen to - hearing it brings a sense of release from cares and comfort for the weary soul. It does not try to push some \"message\" of facile \"world consciousness\" or \"personal growth\" on the listener. It gently weaves along with it's mood of cosmic warmth and a very welcome sense of wonder, twined together with crystal sound-sparkles and strands of singing strings.\nHannah Shapero - Wind ?

Barbara's musical talents were developed early; as a teenager she was already at the center of attention performing at the weekly gathering of Venetian artists and literati, the Accademia dei Unisoni, who met at Strozzi's palazzo.\n\nShe published her first book of songs in 1644, explaining that it is \"the first work that I, as a woman, all too daringly bring to the light of day.\" In the preface, she gives credit to Francesco Cavalli, student and collaborator of Monteverdi, as her teacher. The works recorded here by soprano Emanuella Galli and Galatea come from her seventh publication of 1659 entitled Diporti di Euterpe, or \"The Pleasures of Euterpe.\" In this work, Strozzi, at the height of her artistic powers, collaborates with some of the most important poets of the period to create works which are musically innovative and dramatically expressive as well as being exceedingly beautiful.\n",

    "description": "It is a pleasure to see the rerelease of Paul Beier's first effort on the Baroque Lute, recorded in a small church in Switzerland nearly twenty years ago. He had originally planned a program that included the works presented here, plus the suite in E minor by Bach, but after editing we found that the total time of the recording was over 90 minutes, and so sacrificed the Bach suite to be able to release the CD (which can hold no more than 80 minutes worth of music).\n\nSomewhere, in some now forgotten tape archive, lurks that E minor suite, completely edited but never released! (later re-recorded for an all Bach album.) One of the pieces for this program is the remarkable \"Prelude nel quale sono contenuti tutti i Tuoni Musicali,\" which means \"Prelude, which contains all of the Musical Keys.\" The title sounds a bit funny (it's in antique Italian), because the word \"Tuoni\" also means \"thunder\", so it sounds as if there will be lot of musical thunder here, and, in fact, this turns out to be quite true! The style of the music is very much in keeping with the latest musical currents of the 1740's, and you can hear that Falckenhagen's music has much in common with that of the most radical and innovative composer of the period, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, both in its propensity for cyclical and improvisatory forms and in the development of the Empfindsamer Stil.\n\nBeier has paired this with a long, late work by Silvius Leopold Weiss found in the Glinka manuscript in Moscow. While this work is probably nearly contemporary with that of Falckenhagen, it is another world, musically. It comes at the end of the long, distinguished and prolific career of one of the finest lutenists who ever lived. And even though Weiss's musical style is rather old-fashioned compared with that of his pupil Falckenhagen, in this D major suite one can nevertheless detect that the old hand was not entirely immune to new ways of musical thinking, especially in the Courant and the final Minuet.\n\nThis album, when it was first released by Stradivarius, had many great reviews in CD magazines of the time, and it was even chosen as \"Le Disque Du Mois\" (January 1998) in the French magazine Repertoire, featuring on its cover. I hope it finds favor at its new home with Magnatune!\n",

The six sonatas and one passamezzo-saltarello pair included on this album contain passages of bizarre dissonance whose impact in their own time, noted lutenist and annotator Paul Beier, is difficult for modern listeners to appreciate.\n\nThese sonatas have the relaxed, reflective, fantasy-like structure common in instrumental music of the early seventeenth century, but after a variety of expressive figures have been explored, along comes a really pungent harmonic clash. Beier describes Galilei's struggles with publishers who concluded that he must have made notation mistakes, and he manages to set up the dissonances in such a way that they retain something of their impact: his playing is deliberate and discursive, treating the exploration of the various lute figures as almost scientific in its exploration of all the possibilities. He does not linger over the dissonances, for they are not like those of Gesualdo madrigals; they are merely aspects of musical language to be illustrated and incorporated into rhetorical statements.\nJames Manheim\n",

    "description": "Originally it was thought that there was one \"Knight of the Lute\", Laurencinus Romanus, Il Cavaliere del Liuto, Eques Romanus. After new discoveries and an up-to-date biography of \"The Knights of the Lute\" by Mariagrazia Carlone, published in the Journal of the American Lute Society, we now know that there were two. Lorenzino Tracetti, servant of Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este until 1572, and the pious Vincenzo Pinti, resident at the palace of the Vatican Vice-chancellor under Cardinals Alessandro Farnese and Montalto (Alessandro Peretti), until his death in 1608.\n\nAs for attributing the music, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to tell which of the works recorded here were by Tracetti and which may have been by Pinti. Neither of these composers, it seems, was ever involved directly in the publication or dissemination of their works.\n\nWhile the ambiguity between the two Roman knights is still maintained, the only revision that seems necessary is to the title: no longer singular, it now celebrates \"The Knights of the Lute.\"\n",

    "description": "Rome, 1709. What happened after the great contest? Most lovers of harpsichord lore are familiar with the famous meeting of George Frideric Handel and Domenico Scarlatti where their host, Cardinal Ottoboni, set them to a contest of skill on both harpsichord and organ. When the guests had sufficiently recovered from this audiofest, they generally found Scarlatti to excel on the harpsichord, while Handel was the clear winner on the organ. The two musicians instantly developed a mutual esteem, and their friendship lasted throughout Handel's residence in Rome.\n\nDid the two keyboard virtuosi ever get together long enough to tune two harpsichords to each other (not for the faint-hearted) and play duets? Or were they condemned always to the polarities of the harpsichordist; that is, the lofty, but lonely, prominence of the soloist, or the supportive, self-effacing role of the continuo player? History (like our news media) tends to concentrate on incidents charged with dramatic conflict, so we must become historical novelists to picture happy afternoons with Handel and Scarlatti entertaining a few choice friends and patrons with the bristling excitement that can only be generated by two harpsichords exchanging tunes.\n\nNapa Valley, California, 1993. Enter Katherine Westine and Phebe Craig, beside themselves with a shared vision to breathe new life into a genre both delicate and robust. Phebe Craig and Katherine Westine not only recreate old treasures, but also apply their baroque sensibilities to the works of modern composers. Armed with two Italian and two French harpsichords, Westine and Craig explore the acoustics of a converted 19th century winery (complete with bats). On this recording you will hear the Italian harpsichords for the music of J.S. Bach and Scott Joplin, and the French harpsichords for the remaining selections. The astute listener will quickly notice the distinct character of each instrument, a property of harpsichords which, in contrast to modern keyboard instruments, provides enormous satisfaction to the connoisseur. The musical selections. In 1789, Charles Burney wrote that Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1710-1784) 'was the best organist in Germany, in style, fancy and knowledge of harmony...particularly in the use of pedals.' Apparently W.F. Bach was not widely recognized as a composer in his own time, but his surviving music demonstrates a unique personality. This son of the great J.S. Bach seemed to enjoy straddling the esthetic fence between baroque and rococo, especially in the Concerto in F Major for Two Harpsichords. The first movement is a fine example of early classical sonata form, while the second and third movements make a comfortable return to baroque concerto style.\n\nAbsorption of local color into formal music is also a feature of Antonio Soler (1729-1783), in the tradition of his teacher, Domenico Scarlatti. Soler wrote six concerti for two organs 'for the diversion' of his young pupil, 'the most Serene Infante Don Gabriel de Borbon,' favorite son of Carlos III. It is likely that these concerti were written for performance on two small, similar organs which stood in the little theater at El Escorial. The Concierto II heard on this recording is saturated with Spanish flavor (saffron, pimiento, sangria, sherry) and the listener can easily discern a Spanish guitar style in the energetic plucking of the two harpsichords. Impressionable listeners might detect the fragrance of a rose on a sultry evening.\n\nA master of the French baroque style, Francois Couperin (1668-1733) shared the enthusiasm of his contemporaries for the folk dance tunes and rhythms associated with bagpipe and hurdy-gurdy music. Numerous stage productions of this period feature musetes complete with singing, dancing, and orchestra enhanced by specialized instruments. With his Musetes de Choisi et de Taverni, Couperin reaches back to his family roots and refashions folk music from the towns of Choisi and Taverny to chamber music for the court of Louis XIV, the Sun King.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) was frequently inspired to create extravagantly tuneful works for multiple harpsichords, occasionally transforming music from other sources to endow them with new expression on plucked keyboards. J. S. Bach's concerti were often performed at Zimmermann's coffee house in Leipzig, often with the participation of his sons Carl Philipp Emanuel and Wilhelm Friedemann. (We are not aware of any scholarly studies associating the high energy of the Bach family concerti with the influence of coffee.) The Concerto in C Major for Two Harpsichords is an outstanding example of the mature baroque concerto; while conforming to a standard three-movement concerto structure, its polyphonic richness goes far beyond the formulas of a mere occasional concerto.\n\nWith the Stoptime Rag of Scott Joplin (1868-1917). Westine and Craig present a significant historical event: the first interactive harpsichord CD. In the original publication of this charming dance, the composer annotated the downbeats with the word 'Stamp' to indicate that this piece is not complete without some percussive footwork. Gentle listener, kindly stamp one of your feet with your heel to propel this tuneful ditty on its way. Improvised toe-tapping may be added to taste.\n",

    "description": "For every theory, there is a cure.\n\nBoston-based independent electronic rock artist Psycliq has returned once again with an incredibly diverse and powerful album, \"The Cure for Chaos Theory\". Four years in the making, this seventeen track album contains over an hour of new, original music and is the most ambitious work from Psycliq to date. While focusing on electronic elements more than ever before, the project encompasses a number of different genres, as has come to be expected from this artist, and the production quality is the highest to date.\n\nSomewhat of a concept album without the overtones of a pretentious drama club, \"The Cure for Chaos Theory\" brings the listener on a journey of emotions and places like none other. From the driving energy of opening track \"The Theory\", through the cacophonous racket of \"The Chaos\", to the final placid strains of \"The Cure\" (punctuated with real HAM radio recordings received from a NASA engineer), this album has much to show you if you're willing to come along for the ride. The three-piece suite \"It's Meant To Be\" is spread throughout the album, offering instrumental punctuation to the process. \"Her Ice-Lit Walk\" paints a haunting contrast of calm and chaos, while \"Rewire\" offers a stuttering technological jump. \"Perilous Opportunity\" and \"Snowrunner\" both explode with walls of audio, while the plaintive \"Sad, I Could Have Made You Queen Of The Seas\" paints a picture of acquiescent regret. And for the first time ever, \"Brushwork\" features a stellar guest vocal performance by the immensely talented Jon Wiltzen.\n\nPsycliq has upped the ante with this project, and there's no telling where this artist can go from here.\n\nAwesome extra album material available if you download the artwork in this album.\n",

Written, recorded, and produced entirely by Justin Richer in a home studio.\n\nThe album opens with a straight-forward rock riff in \"Every Morning Orange and Blue\", a song that could easily be the soundtrack to a triathlete's morning workout routine. The three-part \"Resonance Suite\" is spread across the album and features different aspects built on the same harmonic foundation. The ambient anthem \"Adore\" is an intricate electronic piece that weaves back and forth across the depths of space. \"Negative Space\" on the other hand is a rhythmic experiment that questions what happens to us at the very edge of those depths. \"This Town Loves You, This Town Will Destroy You\" is another fast-paced rock number that is first driven by a guitar and then by a piano. The mellower \"Everglow\" is a song complex in its simplicity. Recorded using only a single guitar dubbed five times over, it has a surprising depth of interplay in its parts. Finally, \"Every Evening Crimson Resound\" brings a solemn end to this album, calling to mind feelings of wandering alone at dusk along empty city sidewalks.\n",

Originally a folk blues ballad, the song came to notoriety in the 1960's when British rock group \"The Animals\" released their now iconic rendition of it to worldwide acclaim. It has since been picked up by many different artists, but none have put quite the unique spin on it that \"Psycliq\" has.\n\nWhat started as a simple exercise to cover a single song quickly spiraled into a complicated project of four very distinct remixes, each capturing different aspects of the material. Incorporating more moving parts than any Psycliq recording to date, the steady groove of the original mix quickly gives way to a cacophonous barrage of audio bliss, taking you along on the bluesman's sad tale of warning and woe. The Amped Up Blender mix cranks up the drums and guitars to eleven and never looks back. The Transistor Party Stomp mix somehow manages to add even more layers on top of the already full palette, and its driving rhythm makes no apologies for its pace. At the other end of the rail line, the Organ Donor mix strips everything away again to its raw essentials.\n",

The jazz, blues, and classical elements that underlie the usual Psycliq music are brought to the fore in the artist's most ambitious project to date.\n\nThe sonic landscape ranges from the majestic \"Those Born of Kings\" into the contemplative \"Another Empty Hour In Every Day\"; from the lonely blues rock of \"Dustwood\" to the brash groove of \"Setting Out\"; from the sly jazz of the \"Incognito Shuffle\" to the complex layers of \"Mettle\"; this album manages all of these diverse styles and more with aplomb and grace.\n\nThis may not sound like the usual Psycliq fare, but be assured that the roots are still there, pulsing with every ounce of life and energy you would expect. Expectations and formulas may be left at the door, thank you.\n\nAll songs and instrumentation are once again the sole work of Justin Richer, the unique mind behind this unique band.\n",

    "description": "Viola da gamba music from 1553 to the present day:\n\n\"With this recording I wanted to go back to my original fascination with the 6- or 7-stringed bass viol. Ever since I first heard the instrument in the early 1990's, I knew that this was the sound that I wanted and I have devoted the bigger part of my professional life to it. The solo sound of the instrument especially has always inspired me to no end.\n\nThe recording venue was easily selected and actually sparked the recording: the beautiful chapel of a St. Francis' Convent in my home town of Utrecht. The brethren, some of whom I have known for many years now, have cooperated in every possible way. I have prayed with them many times in this chapel and it is a rare privilege to have been given the opportunity to make this recording in this sacred place.\n\nThe music has more or less selected itself: I wanted to start with some of the very early viola da gamba music by Ortiz and end with some pieces that contemporary composers have dedicated to me. And the centuries in between are covered by the music of much-loved viol composers as Abel, Hume, Forqueray, Schenck, and of course Marais. It all flowed together naturally: confluentes.\n\nThe recording process was very, very simple: my good friend Fritz de With set up his video and audio equipment and I played every piece a few times. Afterwards, we just picked what we considered to be the best version. Again: without any editing. Everything you hear is exactly the way it was played. A rare occurrence these days!\n\nI gave everything I have in this process, and this is it. I can only hope you like it.\"\n\nRalph Rousseau Meulenbroeks, October 2014.\n\nCover art photograph of Ralph courtesy of Jan Baks\n",

A well known Dutch music critic even coined the term \"Gambomaniac\" to desribe Meulenbroeks' passion for the instrument, and since then the artist has received numerous requests for a follow-up album. Gambomania is that album, and it features works by Hume, Marais, Abel, D'Hervelois, and Schenck. It's a richly resonant instrumental recording of Meulenbroeks' solo playing, and it makes apparent why Meulenbroeks' releationship with this instrument is sometimes likened to a \"love affair.\" Sensitive, passionate, dynamic.\n",

In his life he fathered 19 children, was an amateur painter, and wrote a lot of exquisite music for Louis XIV's favorite instrument: the viola da gamba. His name has since become synonymous with the gamba, much like recording artist Ralph Rousseau Meulenbroeks--or the \"gambomaniac\" as he's sometimes called. Known for his dramatic, engaging performances, Meulenbroeks maintains a relationship to the gamba that has been likened to a \"love story,\" and his affinity for it-as well as for Marais-is audible in this recording.

Picture a journey on a magic carpet ride over a turbulent and roaring sea while laying on pillows of silk and down, flying through the white capped waves. Opium dreams you say? Montford knows exactly how to evoke these grandiose visions with his flawless playing and keep you in a state of unencumbered sensory bliss the whole way through.\n\nCould Ray Montford be Canada's own Jeff Beck? With this gift of an album where so many emotions are touched on throughout, one has to think he may just be carving out his own path as a guitarist and letting his playing do the talking. Perhaps no one could ever fill the shoes of the guitar gods of the past but it doesn't seem that Ray has set out to achieve this shadow goal. His playing is unique, honest, and still enthusiastic which is rare these days as instrumentals go. His love for the guitar shines through the music which in essence keeps you, as the listener, so connected to his playing. Ray's songs become the canvas of ones imagination and boldly paint a vision where voice and lyrics have no place over the roar of one man and his guitar.\n",

    "description": "Domenico Bianchini (c1510-c1576) was born into a family of famous Venetian mosaic artists, and, judging by his nickname, 'Il Rossetto', he must have possessed a head of striking red hair, similar to the famous Venetian composer of the early 18th century, Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nBianchini's \"Intabolatura de Lauto\" (Venice, 1546), of which this recording features the entire book, was his sole publication. Intabolatura was a great success, being reprinted in its entirety at least three times, 11 of its works even being reprinted in Nuremberg by Hans Gerle, 1552. The book itself is a perfect exemplar of the Venetian lute book of the mid-16th century, featuring intabulations of scared and secular vocal music, a selection of polyphonic recercari, and a selection of dances, including dances local to Venice, such as the 'Santo erculano'. The music itself is complex, beautiful, at times reflective, and at times flamboyant. The book presents a veritable feast of European lute music.\n\nThe music was performed on a Renaissance Lute by James Marriage (2004) after Hans Frei (c1550), strung entirely in old Aquila nylgut. The disc was recorded fairly intimately and with little editing so as to produce a fresh and candid sound, suited to the intimacy and immediacy of the music. It is the first in a series of recordings by Richard MacKenzie focusing on the repertoire of lutes and early guitars. (Produced and engineered by Richard MacKenzie. Recorded at St. Margaret's Church, Binsey).\n\n'Highly recommended.... an excellent debut recording and makes a very good case for Bianchini's music: if you want Bianchini this is the one to have. MacKenzie plays strongly and rhythmically, and it is heartening to hear the fast embellishments and cadential passages played cleanly and in tempo, something we associate with Paul O'Dette. It has the rhythmic drive and excitement of a live recital and very good recorded sound.'\nLute News, 04/13\n",

    "description": "Albert de Rippe (c1500-1551) was one of the most famous lutenists of his generation. In service to Francis I, his annual salary was double that of any other lutenist. His surviving works exhibit a complexity previously unidentified in lute music. Albert's pupil, Guillaume Morlaye (c1510-1558), was responsible for the posthumous publication of most of Albert's surviving output, and was also a composer of outstanding quality in his own right. In August 1551 Adrian Le Roy (c1520-1598) and his cousin Robert Ballard (c1525-1588) founded the fertile printing firm of \"Le Roy and Ballard\", obtaining a royal privilege from Henry II to publish music. The fruits of that partnership form the core of the musical selection that comprises this album, featuring preludes, fantasies, dances, chansons, motets and grounds.\n\nThe works themselves are multifaceted, attractive, at times meditative, and at times ostentatious. The cross-section of works presented here perfectly sum up the Parisian chordophonic culture of the mid-16th century.\n\nThe music was performed upon a Renaissance Lute built by James Marriage (2004) after Hans Frei (c1550), and upon a Renaissance Guitar built by Paul Baker (2003) of his own design. The album was recorded fairly intimately and with little editing so as to produce a fresh and candid sound, suited to the intimacy and immediacy of the music. It is the second in a series of recordings by Richard MacKenzie focusing on the repertoire of lutes and early guitars. (Produced and engineered by Richard MacKenzie. Recorded at the Church of St. Lawrence, Heanor).\n\nReviews:\n\"MacKenzie plays throughout with effortless ease... The chordal versions are played crisply with a steady beat and a strong sense of rhythm; the rapid diminutions executed with almost breathtaking virtuosity... These [fantasias] are performed with great sensitivity, the contrapuntal lines clearly delineated with subtle variations in timbre and dynamic... MacKenzie obviously loves this music and can't help but play it in a way which makes the listener love it too.\"\nLute News, 10/14 (The Lute Society)\n\n\"The sound is clear and sweet, the playing is impeccable.\"\nNostalgia Newsletter, 10/14 (Lute and Early Guitar Society Japan)\n\n\"Richard MacKenzie... [is] one of the rising stars of the British lute scene... It is a very accomplished recording; the lutenist consistently attaining the beautiful bell-like tone, sweet and clear, that devotees of Renaissance lute (and four-course) guitar aim for, and the musicianship is confident throughout... Let's hope for more like this.\"\nEarly Music Today Magazine, March-May 2015 (Rhinegold Publishing)\n\nFull liner notes are available with the artwork pdf.\n",

    "name": "Riot Kings",
    "description": "The Riot Kings' self-titled album starts with a massive hard-hitting punch and doesn't let up the whole way through. \"Death Valley\" kicks off this masterful production with a slight Rob Zombie vibe and then vocalist Kent Johannesen lets loose with the vocals. He sounds a bit like the singer from Systematic, a rather good band that never got the acclaim it should have. His voice is strong, the musicianship is solid, and the opening track is an excellent introduction into the world of Riot Kings.\n\n\"Save Me\" starts with a guitar riff that positively screams. The rhythm of this piece is headbanging material all the way. The rest of the band falls into place behind that killer guitar and the vocals in this track are rather diverse, coupling rock with a bit of rap. Kent pulls it off exceedingly well. \"Save Me\" is a wonderful creation of various different influences such as Soundgarden and perhaps a touch of Pantera.\n\n\"Killing Time\" gives us a dose of some serious funk. This piece leaves the listener with no doubt whatsoever that Riot Kings mean business. Crossing multiple genres, \"Killing Time\" graces us with funk, punk, and rock'n'roll. The instrumentation is phenomenal, the vibe is brazen and bold, and the listener gets a very clear idea that this is a band capable of transcending musical boundaries.\n\n\"Killing Time\" fades out slowly and takes us gently into \"The Past\", which features some fantastic piano work. The listener may be lulled into a false sense of reverie, perhaps thinking that this is going to be a love song, or maybe a slow ballad. Nope. \"The Past\" is just as hard as the rest of them, and now the bass player gets to show what he's made of. The bass line is what carries this tune and Faith No More comes to mind, especially when the vocals kick in and Kent belts out his lyrics with a Mike Patton-esque delivery. The distortion used on the vocals adds a twisted touch to this song that is perfect.\n\nMoving right along, \"Hypocrisy\" begins with a synthesizer and a spacey sort of riff that is a new twist on this journey. They quickly revert back to the norm of heavy guitar, strong vocals, and tight musicianship all around. However, while this piece isn't that different from the rest of the album, there is certainly a darker vibe to this track and Kent's vocals bring to mind Vinnie Dombroski of Sponge. He really expands his range in this song and the listener may have more appreciation for what a fantastic job this band does to deliver their music to the masses.\n\n\"Holy Christian Bible Rocket\" is another Funk Rock number that gets the feet tapping and the head banging. It starts off with out-of-this-world sound effects before Kent steps in with his unique way of delivering rock music with a rap touch. He can scream one minute and rap the next and he does both equally well. \"Lift Off\" is a continuation of \"Holy Christian Bible Rocket\". There is funk to this track as well, more so than any of the other tracks, and Riot Kings once more prove that their diversity and talent is unmatched. \"Lift Off\" is an extremely short tune and it is the perfect compliment to the preceding track.\n\n\"Guillotine\" begins with sound effects suggesting Nine Inch Nails, but that is where any semblance ends. Once the music starts and Kent begins to sing, the vibe is punk all the way, but there seems to be a slight Metallica influence in the guitar work. Riot Kings have mastered the art of combining so many different genres and influences that punk coupled with Metallica should surprise no one, although it should make listeners aware of the sheer breadth of talent that this quartet possesses. \"Guillotine\" is an excellent example of the culmination of the musical experience that is evident within this band.\n\nRiot Kings obviously have the talent, skills and experience to go far with their artistic endeavors. Not a band that is easily overlooked or forgotten, they will be around for quite some time, keeping the rockers of the world happy.\n\n- Review by Rhonda Readence\n",

A continuing project to uncover the eddies of subtlety and unhurried expression, Cosh's new album, \"PONDER\", slowly meanders down the old trail in the woods - no rush, no agenda. Stopping here and there to take it all in, to pendulum between the whole and parts, letting pieces that fit together do so, and then taking them apart again to see if others might do so better.\n\nPONDER is two albums in one... evocative and down-tempo describe the first half... Edgeless enough to not grab your attention too strongly from the book you are engrossed in while sipping tea. The second half is decidedly ambient, and almost entirely beatless, setting the imagination adrift, anticipating its return after letting it become witness - to itself, it's environment, its presence.\n\nThese two sides of Cosh's peaceful creative output are executed with skill and achieve a sense of space and curiosity which does not fail in drawing the listener deeply inside. Whether its staring out the window, on a couch in a dimly lit room, greeting the morning with coffee and sunlight, or even delighting in the details with headphones on, in the dark....

Push through the Curtain of reality amid a pure harmonic series of high frequency sounds to a world of inner reflection, Point, Line, Plane depicts cosmic clouds of primal resonance, the abstract and mathematical, Plato's Cave, whispers in a multitude of tongues, sonic sign languages of the internal dialogue of pure consciousness, and finally Temple, the sound of a spiritual architectural space of No-thingness.

They shimmer and vibrate. They are both abstract and figurative at the same time. The camera moves slowly while the light moves quickly, burning and flashing brightly at times from the saturated grainy/smooth surface, to remind the viewer that the film itself has become the canvas, as the reflections of projected light act directly upon the retina.\n\nDuring this performance I ventured into the chaotic realm of live feedback loops, using delays and modulation to build up clouds of re-circulating texture. This technique creates sonic structures that resemble slow arcs, growing and collapsing like organisms, or like melting glaciers. An implied harmonic cloud hovers at the edge of dissonance, much like the reflecting beams of color glancing from the films' vibrating multiple projections. The air is energized by the resonance of sound and light.\n",

Over time I have become more relaxed about tuning, shifting where the instruments sound most natural. Nest navigates towards harmonic intervals when piano is absent, toward equal temperament when piano dominates, searching for a certain fragile balance.\n\nNest represents unfinished business for me. It's an album that might have come from my childhood, from a hidden quiet place. I rarely make such calm music. Nest folds inward like a nurturing cushion; yet it never sits motionless, it evolves toward a kernel of revelation with slow searching energy.\n\nNest began with recordings from the eastern Australian bush, when I was on tour in February 2012. I often incorporate natural sounds into my music, but this music wanted to live entirely in outdoor soundscapes, surrounded by a subdued yet palpable sense of life. This texture resembles my earliest releases like Suanyata, Trances and Drones, where the natural world integrates completely with the music.\n\nI approach these juxtapositions of music and nature recordings with caution, as they risk sounding trite. For me, the combination works best when the music retains an attentive, submissive quality. For an album like this, I remove so much material during creation that I struggle to leave any music at all. Each note serves primarily to outline its own absence, to create an illusion of silence.\n",

The rhythmic scaffolding for the album comes from two very different drummers. Ricky Carter adds his intelligent sparse drumming, fluid with syncopation but complex in meter. These rhythms could be a slow tempo homage to Jaki Leibzeit from Can. Post-processing transforms them into rubbery chuffing abstractions. The other rhythmic foundation comes from the Karnatic mrdungam playing of Sakthivel Muruganandhan, which also wanders into Rich's sonic blender, shifting from time-stretched blurs into organic live duets with bansuri master Sunilkumar Sankarapillai.\n\nLilting in and out of this heady atmosphere of South Indian music and minimalist space jazz, the voice of art-pop virtuoso Emily Bezar adds a feminine intelligence to several pieces, and subtle melodic guitar additions from Haroun Serang augment Rich's soaring lap steel feedback. With acoustic bass from Paul Olguin and string additions from Forrest Fang and Magnatune artist, Hans Christian, the sonic texture warms to a glowing woody earthiness. Rich's audiophile production and delicate sound design glue the textures together into a seductive and inviting mossy nest. From these disparate elements, Ylang forms a sonic entity unto itself.\n\n\"A flowering tree that grows in South Asia, Ylang Ylang's fragrance seems to embody elements of shadow and light, eros and gnosis, earth and sky.

But women also contributed to this literature, and in their own songs they take on more life. They are powerful, they are powerless. They are lusty, neurotic, and comically vain. They grieve, they (possibly?) court other women.\n\nAll but one of the melodies for these songs have been lost. Where I can I have borrowed melodies from other troubadour songs. More often, I have written my own settings in the style of that time and place.

The sound reddens. Slowly. Soft whispers. An airy Voice without words. Without sentences. A voice that targets a pure emotional state.\n\n\"When a musician talks about his work it's always delicate but necessary. Necessary because it involves choice and artistic preferences which are not clearly recognisable from a few extracts. My music is meant to be purified, naked, intimate, on the basis only of a piano and a voice.\n\nIs it introversion of classical music? Or rather physical expressiveness more rock or even contemporary? I do not know. I only aim to show resonant and raw emotion, literally meaningless. As a result, I sing with no text, no sentences, no words. Everything here is pure sensation. That is my pleasure, with the hope it can be yours.\"\n\nGuitarist by trade, Rougge first performed in different pop-rock bands before discovering that the piano was in fact to be his instrument. This revelation, which took him to Britain, was without doubt the crucial turning point which made his music sound the way it does today. His voice and his instrument from then on focused on each other and are never going to stop creating and influencing each other. The singing lost any other meaning in order to rediscover the simple pleasure of instrumental improvisations. No texts, sentences nor words. From then on only the emotion produced by the raw sound mattered. The piano part is destructurised, it looks for the murmur, the breath, the cry which this deeply moving voice suggests. From this duality, this particular innovative, supernatural and captivating music was born.\n\nIs it introversion of classical music? Or physical expressiveness more rock or even contemporary? Everyone needs to make up their own mind. His first album Fragments recorded and mixed both in France and England certainly carries his own identity, one which should be discovered.\n",

For this album, he brings in a treasure trove of Middle Eastern percussion: dumbeks, riqqs, dhollo, djembes, davul, finger cymbals, tablas, udu, and various cymbals...all for a performance that grabs your attention from the very first note. Ruben is the winner of the Tama Drummers Award and the Erasmus Rotterdam Jazz Award. Highly recommended for belly dancing and tribal dancing enthusiasts.\n",

In that night's performance, he was given a solo, which was masterful, fun and musical, with lots of unexpected twists (and a few body noises). He now has released 3 CDs of his \"Eastern Expressions\" concept, all of solo percussion. You may think an all percussion album would become monotonous, but the variety of rhythms, melodies and structure keep me entranced for hours, and I often find myself hitting \"shuffle play\" and listening to all 3 albums in a sitting.\n",

Solo piano and solo guitar played from a space of inner reflection, like a wave of peace.\n\nThe quality of water falling on a sun-shower-day translated into sound. Somehow music can filter through to places that are hidden from daylight. You feel music when your mind is open and the rhythm of your footsteps has slowed a little - when you stop and look at the empty space around you, listen to the silence between your words and look into the eyes of a person you love. Then without a warning a space enters you, you relax and for a moment there is unity - a reminding of a place you may have visited when you were young, full of wonder and innocence.\n\nWhat people are saying about this music:\n\"I like the open spaces in the music, the unhurried gentleness. Reminds me of staring into space, sometimes daydreaming, sometimes just staring at nothing. Very nice.\"\n- Fratermus\n\n\"If you need to calm down or meditate this music is perfect. Piano solo pieces alternate with beautiful acoustic guitar. The sound is pure. This music is refreshing just as a glass of pure water or pure air in the mountains.\"\n- Yvalain\n\n\"The most moving song on the album was the track, \"Trusting the Universe.\" It was very touching and sweetly emotional. The guitar was deeply heartfelt on this album and the sounds were kept to a minimum, spare and yet so creative . . . as if the plan was that these tunes were to heal and soothe and comfort the tired and sore souls . . . well it worked! One of my other favorite songs was the sweet, slow and gentle traces of music from the guitar in the song, \"Reflecting the Moon,\" which was so peaceful I felt as if I had relaxed under the white light of a magical moon . . . This album was so good that I couldn't stop playing it all evening . . . it was like sacred medicine to my soul . . . and I needed it . . . and I got it!\n- Orangeupurple\n",

    "description": "There's a line that pops up in Blues songs from time to time: \"it's in him - it's got to come out\". Meaning, of course, some things just shouldn't be suppressed - some things simply must be expressed. So it is with the music making up the Sampson - Carroll album, \"Mandala for Chaos\". No grand plan was involved in its creation. No preconceived notions regarding what might, or might not, be popular. The music simply came forth during the acts of playing. The duo had no idea what they had, until they had it.\n\nThis music comes from intuition - from the gauzy atmosphere of \"Around\", through the percolating \"didgeridoo\" and call-and-response vocal loop of \"Great Lakes Chain Gang\", to the minimalist grandeur of the title track. That intuitive composing brings a wealth of possibilities to the mind's eye. No preconceived aural trips here - the listening journey is as individual as the listener, and is apt to be different each time.\n\n\"Unlike a lot of drone/sparse/minimal ambient music, I enjoyed Mandala for Chaos right away (I usually need a warming up period). Of course, I like the sound of the human voice as an ambient \"instrument\", so take that into consideration. Sampson has an expressive voice and Carroll's guitar, synths, and assorted studio wizardry is impressive to hear. \"\nBill Binkelman / Wind and Wire\n\n\"I would call the material on this disc \"spiritual ambient,\" not only for the place it touches most, but also for it's inspired sound (though it isn't particularly religious). Washes of atmospheric synth, guitar and guitar-synth interplay with silken-threaded, mostly lyricless vocal passages, and occasional ambient chants, creating soothing textures to transport you to a more peaceful place. Meditative and enveloping, the title track, as well as tracks like \"Chasm of Faith\" seem almost holy, not unlike what one might hear upon entering a mystic temple.\"\nDavid Strong / From Dust #4\n\n\"In just about every way as entrancing as Tetsu Inoue's defining Ambient Otaku, Sean Carroll and Jeff Sampson make the passing of time shimmer with energy. \"\nNortheast Performer\n",

    "name": "Biber Violin Sonatas",
    "description": "One outcome of the Catholic Counter-Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries was a new movement in Roman Catholic mysticism. For a circle of religious writers, of whom the Spanish St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) is the best known, the goal was to illuminate the mysteries of the faith and create an emotional state of mind open to the mystical experience. El Greco (1541-1614) translated this movement into painting, taking as his subjects moments of mystical apotheosis and depicting them in an otherworldly and ecstatic style. And H.I.F. Biber (1644-1704) created this same emotional state of mind through the transcendent mysticism of him music.\n\nThe outstanding non-Italian violinist of the century, Biber was born in Bohemia of German descent. He went first into the service of Count Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn of Olomouc, then entered the chapel of the Archbishop of Salzburg, where he remained for the rest of his life, rising to the posts of Kapellmeister and Dean of the Choirboy School. In 1681, Biber published a volume of eight sonatas in Nuremberg including the Sonata No. 6 in C minor which opens this recording. His 15 Mystery or Rosary Sonatas, dating from about 1676, were not published; they survive in an ornate manuscript, in which each sonata is preceded by an engraving depicting an event in the life of Jesus or Mary. (Some of these medallions are reproduced on the cover of this CD.) It is possible that these pieces were meant for performance as postludes for October services at Salzburg Cathedral: October 7 is the Feast of the Rosary. Biber's reputation as a violinist survived into the late 18th century, when the English historian Charles Burney described him thus: \"...of all the violin players of the last century, Biber seems to have been the best, and his solos are the most difficult and most fanciful of any music I have seen of the same period.\" In addition to solo violin music, Biber composed operas and other dramatic works, sacred vocal music, and instrumental music for ensembles of various types.\n\nThough not as influential as Corelli, whose sonatas became the universal model, Biber's compositions for violin are the work of a master who fully understood the technical and expressive possibilities of his instrument and had a flair for highly descriptive music. But the technique with which Biber is most strongly associated is the device known as scordatura. Scordatura, the Italian word for 'mistuning,' means that the violin is tuned in ways other than the standard fifths: G D A E. It is originally a folk fiddling device, and folk fiddlers all over the world use standard scordatura tunings such as A D A D or G C G C as a way to gear the violin towards a specific key and make the double-stops easier.\n\nOf the 15 sonatas in the Rosary collection, only Sonata 1, The Annunciation, uses the standard violin tuning. The other 14 are all in scordatura. Some of the scordaturas require the change of only a single string, such as the G D A D used in The Crucifixion, but some require the change of three strings, like The Assumption of Mary -- A E A D, or even all four, like The Ascension, tuned C E G C.\n\nInterestingly, the c minor sonata from 1681 begins in the standard tuning, but requires the performer to retune his E string down to D halfway through! This retuning is followed by a Gavotte with variations which, despite the French origin of the dance, retains a definite flavor of Bohemian folk music.\n\nBut Biber's use of scordatura goes far deeper than being a means of facilitating double-stops. (They are almost impossible in the standard tuning.) For a more important effect of scordatura is to endow the violin with maximum resonance in one specific key, which both narrows the focus of the violin's 'voice' and deepens its emotional impact. Each retuning changes the violin's sonority--to an almost mystical extent--and give the player a sense of playing on a new and different instrument.\n\nThe Rosary Sonatas are not program music in the 19th-century sense, like the tone poems of Richard Strauss. They are a manifestation of Roman Catholic mysticism, and as such their goal is to personalize the believer's relationship with Christ through meditation on his life and suffering. Just as each of the 15 beads of the rosary represents an event in the New Testament story, each of the Rosary Sonatas represents a meditation on that event.\n\nSome of Biber's musical imagery is specific and graphic, most noticeably in The Crucifixion, where the three notes in the opening measure represent making the sign of the cross (both visually, on the page, and in action, as the violinist bows them), while the rhythm of the dotted triplets in the measure which follows represents both the word \"kreu-zi-ge\" -- crucify -- and the sound of the hammer striking the nails. Bach used the same dotted triplets to set \"kreuzige\" in the St. John Passion.\n\nSimilarly Christ's entrance into heaven in The Ascension is royally heralded by trumpet calls and stately marches. But sometimes Biber's imagery is merely emotive, like the joyful gigue that concludes The Assumption of Mary, a tune similar in appeal to an Irish gig accompanying Mary as she dances off to heaven at the end of her earthly life. Few composers have accomplished the non-linear and almost trance-like quality that marks much of Biber's music, particularly in the quasi-fantasia preludiums that open The Annunciation, The Crucifixion, and The Assumption of Mary. In our own time, perhaps only Messaien has come close.\n\nAs a transition between the four Rosary Sonatas on this recording, each is preceded by a keyboard fantasia in the same rhapsodic style. These interludes are highly representative of the period, for the 17th century saw an explosion of composition for organ, harpsichord and clavichord in German-speaking area. Johann Jacob Froberger (1616-1667) is perhaps the most important German keyboard composer before Bach. He was born in Stuttgart, and by 1637 had become organist at the Viennese Imperial Court. His patron, Emperor Ferdinand III, loved Italian culture, and helped make possible Froberger's 1640-41 study in Rome with Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643), then a leading light of keyboard music in Europe. Froberger remained influential on German composers until well into the 18th century. Ferdinand Tobias Richter (1651-1711) was also an organists at the imperial court, working there from 1683 until his death. Richter's compositions show a flair for the dramatic to be expected from a composer who wrote a great deal of music for use in Jesuit schools.\n",

The next three tunes with Scott on piano begin with a longing solo piece, Snowfall, and then see him joined by bassist Brad Albin for Imagine, a jazz contrafact and Susurro (Whisper), a bossa/ballad.\n\nThe last three pieces are unique collaborations: Spirits of the Dead is a completely free musical improvisation (no sheet music or pre-conceived ideas) in response to an eerie poem by Edgar Allan Poe. (Scott had not had the opportunity to play with trumpeter Rod McGaha before, nor has he since.) Sin Lux represents a similar effort with saxophonist Mitch Reilly one year later. The bonus track, Film Noir, is a piece Scott wrote specifically for trumpeter/friend Leif Shires in a lush, 1950's jazz-cum-orchestra style, which was recorded for Leif's debut album, Rapture.\n\nMost of the album was performed and recorded live on Nashville's NPR affiliate, WPLN, during several different sessions between Oct. 30, 2007 and Jan. 10, 2010.

Cranz. It is admired for the intricacy and technicality in the beauty it portrays. Published in 1801, it is dedicated to the Count Joseph von Sonnenfels. This sonata was written at a time when Beethoven's alarm at his worsening deafness was increasing. Nevertheless, Beethoven paints a serene image with this sonata.\n\nThe Piano Sonata No. 16 in G major, Op. 31 No. 1, was composed between 1801 and 1802. Due to his dissatisfaction with the 'classical' style of music, Beethoven pledged to 'take a new path' of musical composition and style. The Opus 31 works are the first examples of Beethoven's new innovative and unconventional ideas, an attempt to make a name for himself in the annals of music history. In critical terms, this sonata is light, breezy and has touches of humour and irony amongst its movements. Critics say that the Opus 31 works show now a more pronounced 'Beethovenian' sense of style that will become more evident in later, mature works.\n\nThe Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor, Op. 31, No. 2, was composed in 1801/02. It is usually referred to as 'The Tempest', but this title was not given by him, or indeed referred to as such during his lifetime; instead, it comes from a claim by his associate Anton Schindler that the sonata was inspired by the Shakespeare play\n\nHear Beethoven as you have never heard it before, getting lost in the world of invigorating ideas and emotional virtuosity that has made Sebastian Forster one of the outstanding interpreters of the classical repertoire currently working on the world stage today.\n",

(The \"grand\" modifier was applied by Beethoven to sonatas with four movements instead of three). The sonatas after this one find Beethoven experimenting more with form and concept.\n\nBeethoven composed his Piano Sonata N. 12, Op. 26 in 1800-1801, around the same time as he completed his First Symphony. He dedicated the sonata to Prince karl von Lichnovsky, who had been his patron since 1792. The structure of the sonata is unconventional in that the piece opens with a relatively slow movement in the format of theme and variations. In contrast, the remaining movements of the sonata proceed according to classical principles in fast-slow-fast alternation.\n\nBeethoven's Piano Sonata in E flat major \"Quasi una fantasia\", Op. 27 No. 1, composed in 1800-1801, has four movements. Beethoven included the phrase \"Quasi una fantasia\" (Italian: Almost a fantasy) in the title because the sonata does not follow the traditional sonata pattern where the first movement is in regular sonata form, and the movements are arranged in a fast-slow-fast sequence.\n\nThe Piano Sonata N. 14 in C# minor \"Quasi una fantasia\", Op. 27, No. 2, popularly known as the Moonlight Sonata, was completed in 1801. It is dedicated to his pupil, 17-year-old Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, with whom Beethoven was, or had been, in love.

A playful jocularity is maintained throughout the piece, earning it the occasional nickname of The Hunt, although like many of Beethoven's early works, the 'jocular' style can be heard as a facade, concealing profound ideas and depths of emotion. The sonata consists of four movements.\n\nThe Piano Sonata No. 19 in G minor, Op. 49, No. 1, and Piano Sonata No. 20 in G major, Op. 49, No. 2, are short (and are considered relatively simple sonatas by some pianists) by Ludwig van Beethoven, published in 1805 (although the works were likely composed several years earlier). Both works are approximately eight minutes in length, and are split into two movements. These sonatas are referred to as the Leichte Sonaten to be given to his friends and students.\n\nThe Piano Sonata No. 20 was possibly written around the time Beethoven composed the third and fourth sonatas, but because it was published in Vienna in 1805, nearly a decade after it was actually written, it was assigned then-current opus and sonata numbers, which classified it alongside works from the composer's middle period. Very similar circumstances caused Beethoven's B-flat Piano Concerto to appear as his second, even though it predated the first.\n\nBeethoven often suppressed works in his early years, either revising them later for publication or determining that they were not fit. In fact, he withheld many early works from publication for life. In the case of these two sonatas, it was Caspar van Beethoven, the composer's brother, who decided they were worthy of publication. Against the composer's will, he presented them to a publishing house, thus allowing posterity to hear works that might otherwise have been lost or destroyed.\n\nBeethoven's Piano Sonata No. 21 in C major, Op. 53, known as the Waldstein, is one of the three most notable sonatas of his middle period beside the Appassionata, Op. 57, and Les Adieux, Op. 81a. Completed in summer 1804 and surpassing Beethoven's previous piano sonatas in its scope, the \"Waldstein\" is a key early work of Beethoven's 'Heroic' decade (1803-1812) and set a standard for piano composition in the grand manner. The sonata's name derives from Beethoven's dedication to his close friend and patron Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein of Vienna. Like the Archduke Trio (one of many pieces dedicated to Archduke Rudolph), it is named for Waldstein even though other works are dedicated to him. It is also known as 'L'Aurora' (The Dawn) in Italian, for the sonority of the opening chords of the third movement, which conjures an image of daybreak.\n\nOne of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas, the first section of the Rondo requires a simultaneous pedal trill, high melody and rapid left hand runs while its coda's glissando octaves, written in dialogue between the hands, compel even advanced performers to play in a simplified version since it is more demanding to play on the heavier action of a modern piano than on an early 19th Century instrument.\n\nHear Beethoven as you have never heard it before, getting lost in the world of invigorating ideas and emotional virtuosity that has made Sebastian Forster one of the outstanding interpreters of the classical repertoire currently working on the world stage today.\n",

    "description": "Not content to ease into a comfortable niche, Minneapolis modern rock band Seconds Before fuses high octane rock, memorable pop sensibilities, and progressive arrangements into a sound that's as hard to pigeonhole as it is to resist.\n\nChange Is The Only Constant is Seconds Before's most accomplished and complete work to date. The album rocks with a confidence that comes with years of experience and features songs that you just might not be able to get out of your head (in the good way, not the annoying way).\n\nChange Is The Only Constant might as well be the motto of the current decade, and there's no question the sound of this band has evolved over their nine-year existence. Sure, the trademark twin guitar interplay is still there, along with soaring vocal harmonies and one of the hardest hitting rhythm sections around, but on this record there's a definite sense of the unexpected.\n\nInspired by the highs and lows of life in their hometown (including a sincere reflection on the heroes and victims of the 35W bridge collapse in \"Calling Home\"), the album represents the band's most mature and honest songwriting to date.\n\nThere's no pretense to any artificial rock star fantasy here. This is rock about real life performed by five working guys who haven't forgotten the simple joy of turning amps up loud and singing at the top of their lungs. So give the newest Seconds Before album a spin or nine, but don't get too comfortable, because change is... well, you know.\n",

This is the most focused, cohesive album by SGX focusing on instrumental pieces.\n\nUnlike his previous albums such as Chroma and Synesthetic which feature a mixture of not only genres, but tones, Hero of the Grey Area exudes a more homogeneous tone and feeling while still exploring fusing ideas from many genres. This is music for listening and sometimes takes its time exploring an idea in the vein of BT's \"This Binary Universe.\"\n\nHero of the Grey Area features \"A Meal for a Whale\" - a track made with only a software sequencer/sampler, a piano, and the audio toy/game Electroplankton for the Nintendo DS as sound sources. SGX effects, samples, records, and manipulates his way through this at once lo-fi and lush recording creating tides of relaxed beauty and exuberance.\n\nAlso featured is the four-movement \"i.transmit.this\" - an exercise in re-use and modulation of interchangeable musical ideas. SGX begins with simple overlapping piano melodies that appear and re-appear in later parts of the piece as different instruments and ideas, inspiring new ideas. \"I Transmit This\" branches, grows new limbs, and finally returns to the main concepts which in the end bear the influences of the new ideas that were themselves inspired by the original concepts.\n",

So if somebody want to know how \"Shino\" sounds like, he/she should listen to this album.\n\nHowever, because of the much better quality of the sound, it is worthwhile for all the people, who already know my music to re-experience these songs. Because with Transition the music is a bit closer to the listener. Furthermore there are two new songs (Melancholia and Fall Days), one very old, but never recorded song (Schlaflied - Lullaby) and \"My Mistress\" as guitar version.\n\nTransition stands for passage, change, even mutation and metamorphosis. This album presents a mental process, where the human personality is searching for the light, explanations, sense and in this way it can learn the inner cleaning. Everything that i want to come alive with these 21 songs, is some kind of catharsis of modern age - the search for the very own but abstract I.\n\nThe order of the songs is chronological (not Schlaflied, it ought to be at the beginning) and some songs are much older than the project \"Shino\". In that way you can find the expression of my own search, my own catharsis, my own path in these songs.\n\nThanks to everybody, who supports me! Everybody who listens to my songs... Everybody who can feel and understand my songs... Everybody who plays and distributes my songs...

    "description": "\"Chominciamento di gioia\", or \"The Dawn of Joy\", is the title of a dance from a collection of medieval instrumental pieces in what is known (quite prosaically) as British Library, Additional 29987.\n\nThis manuscript, now in London, contains 119 compositions, all by composers of the Italian Trecento. Among the best known today are Francesco Landini, Niccolo da Perugia, and Jacopo da Bologna.\n\nThe instrumental works in the manuscript are grouped together and consist of several Istanpitte, Salterelli, and other dances. All have intriguing names, such as the title dance of our CD. Another memorable title, Principio de Virtu, might refer to a connection of the manuscript with the Visconti family in Milan: Gian Galeazzo Visconti was known as the Count of Virtu.\n\nThe Istanpitta, or Estampie, is the only medieval dance form for which descriptions as well as music have survived. Each phrase, or punctum, in an estampie is repeated. A refrain of differing length is inserted after each iteration of a phrase, alternating open and closed endings. The Salterello follows the same principle but tends to be shorter and less complicated in character.\n\nIt is quite extraordinary that these dances were written down at all, since we know that the players of these pieces, known as minstrels or jongleurs, mostly improvised their art. Successful minstrels needed a tinker's bagful of talents. According to Guiraut de Calancon (Fadet Joglar), they were expected to play at least nine instruments, have a knack for storytelling and songwriting, sing, improvise dances, juggle, perform magic tricks, demonstrate acrobatic skills, catch little apples on knives, imitate birdsong, jump through four hoops, and, if possible, dance with bears!\n\nAlthough playing for dancers would have been an important part of the professional musicians' job, they didn't hesitate to play vocal works. They made their own arrangements or improvised on songs their audiences knew. Even in church this practice was not unknown: the famous hymn Ave maris stella served as the base for a highly ornamented version in the Faenza Codex, a 15th-century manuscript containing instrumental arrangements of mostly 14th-century vocal polyphony.\n\nWomen played instruments, as amateurs and as professionals. Francesco da Barberino, in his Reggimento e costumi di donna, a 14th-c. treatise on the education of young women, states that they should learn to play instruments, especially the vielle and the harp; they should know how to sing and compose text and music and be able to perform these songs, accompanying themselves. In Boccaccio's Decameron female musicians outnumber the male players.\n",

I particularly remember Dowland's renaissance-smash-hit \"Flow my Tears\" performed on four accordeons. Shira plays the Vielle, which is a precursor to the violin, and it's where we get the word \"fiddle\" from. She a big deal in medieval circles, having been in many of the major groups that play this repertoire (Ensemble Alcatraz, Project Ars Nova, Sequentia, Hesperion XX and Boston Camerata). In \"Ragged, Rent and Torn\", Shira and friends turn their attention to the bawdy, fun and lewd songs of the period. The artistry is definitely taken seriously, but at the same time this is an album of music \"just for fun\".\n",

    "name": "A Dream Play",
    "description": "S.J. Pettersson's second classical release is an unorthodox opera (with as many instrumental tracks as vocal ones) based on the famous 1901 stage play \"A Dream Play\" by August Strindberg, one of Strindberg's most admired and influential dramas, seen as an important precursor to both dramatic expressionism and surrealism.\n\nStrindberg himself describes the play this way in his famous preface: \"Everything can happen; everything is possible and likely to happen. Time and space do not exist; on an insignificant foundation of reality the imagination spills out and weaves new patterns - a concoction of memories, experiences, improbabilities and utterly free improvisations. The characters are split in twain, duplicate, multiply and evaporate. They condense, distill and again reunite. But one mind rises above them all. It is the Dreamer; for him there are no secrets, no consistencies, no scruples, no Law. He does not judge, nor gives out pardons but impartially relates the content of the dream itself. And as the dream often painful is, and much less often joyfully free-spirited, there is a tone of sadness and empathy with everything alive in this labyrinthine tale now beginning to unfold.\"\n\nThe primary character in the play is Agnes, a daughter of the Vedic god Indra. She descends to Earth to bear witness to problems of human beings. She meets about 40 characters, some of them having a clearly symbolical value (such as four deans representing theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). After deciding to experience human life first hand by becoming a human, she experiences all sorts of human suffering such as poverty, cruelty, and the often difficult routine of family life. She marries and has a child but in the end the daughter of gods realizes that human beings are to be pitied and is faced with heartbreaking choice: to return to the Heavens in an attempt to persuade her Father Indra to intervene and ease the suffering of humanity, or to stay on Earth and care for her earthly child. Finally, she returns to the Heaven and this moment corresponds to the awakening from a dream-like sequence of events.\n\nS.J. Pettersson's treatment of the play is to basically tell the story, or often, as is the case with the purely instrumental pieces, through emotions. The scenes are replaced with lyrical narratives, often in first person, and characters just mentioned in passing, comes alive with their own tales. There is no attempt to re-tell the story (which in itself is as difficult to follow and make sense out of as indeed our dreams are) but rather to express it in another medium in the terms of that medium's capability to reach where the written word is not able to penetrate. The result is almost closer to a song cycle (using 4 different vocal soloists that are all as similar as they are different in character, much like the shifting characters of the play) and with powerful instrumental pieces that in an almost hyper-romantic fashion carry the narrative along with their own emotional contents. The musical style is highly anachronistic but the perhaps biggest influence seems to be Weill's German operas from the 1920s blended with elements of Bach, Shubert, Chopin, Prokofiev's lyrical side, even Shostakovich at time. It is a very accessible work often hiding its harmonic and rhythmical complexity below the surface. The performances throughout are stellar with many of Los Angeles top classical musicians lending their hands and, seemingly, their hearts. The vocal performances are highly unusual and emotionally effective, often sung in pure tone avoiding vibrato and with an approach to communicate the often difficult scenes without resorting to obvious vocal tricks and audience pandering. As a result, the suffering seems to be located internally rather than externally which in many ways increases the personal aspect of what is a universal condition.\n\nThe libretto is poetically very beautiful and in the end leaves the play behind with a final piece, Hope, that seems to transfer the words and thoughts from that of Strindberg to the composers own mouth.\n",

    "description": "Romeo and Juliet is the second ballet from Swedish born composer S.J. Pettersson.\n\nIt is written and performed for and by a chamber orchestra, albeit with some odd instrumentation thrown in for good measure.\n\nHis approach is as usual very poly-stylistic with an oboe melody opening the Prologue as a nod to Tchaikovsky and a violin passage in the elegy like movement that conjures up Prokofiev. Then we hear Bartok-like aggressive pieces mixed with hyper romantic melodies reminiscent of Satie set in a post minimalist soundscape that in spite of the varied ingredients still manages to retain a firm consistency as a whole.\n\nHis approach to telling the story progresses \"backwards\" with the death scene of the two Star Cross'd lovers opening the ballet and the rest of the story being told as a flashback focusing almost exclusively on the two main characters. All of the titles are culled from the play by Shakespeare and the people knowledgeable with the play will have no problems putting them in context of the story.\n\nThe instrumental (and vocal) performances are nothing short of heartbreaking and the work is performed by some of the finest classical musicians around today including Yana Reznik on the piano and Maksim Velichkin on cello just to name two. It is truly a remarkable and magic journey that concludes triumphantly as an homage to love, rather than the tragedy of two lovers unintended suicide.\n",

Featuring serpentine vocals of Kate St. Pierre, masterfully detailed percussion of Ruben Von Rompaey, and pristine instrumentation by Tim Rayborn and J.M. Soto, this album seems a particularly princely jewel in the already very bedecked Solace crown. The sound design and production are downright superlative. We particularly love the dynamic breaks of \"Sorrow and Veil\" as well as the modern seduction of the title track, \"Nagari,\" but the best track on the album by far is the undulating \"Condemnation,\" a track resplendent in sexiness and self-control. If you're a patient enough audiophile to snag the WAV files for this album, you're in for a treat when you listen to \"Pharisees Prayer\" on headphones. We could say this album features a blend of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, but the two are so seamlessly joined together, you'll hardly notice. Rather, you'll hear a kind of musical path beng laid out for you, one that takes you deep into forbidden, ancient places as well as strange new territories.\n",

'Rescue Me' is a classic power ballad; 'Underneath it All' a rage against people who disappoint you in life; 'Circle of Lies' about the screaming souls a loveless couple; 'Fear is the Enemy' an inspirational motivator and 'Winter Kiss' a Snow White fantasy duet with Male singer Clayton Mitchell.\n\nSophia also continues as she did on her first album to try and honestly express female sexuality, without falling into the contrived titillation of modern pop music, with 'Take Me', 'The Swinger' and 'No Escape'. She sends a message out to those who may pass judgement with the anthemic song 'Wicked Angel'. Originally this was to be the title of the album, but late inclusion of the song 'You Are Evil', induced a change, which, it is hoped, will produce a little thought about what 'Evil' actually is.\n",

The result is a heady, colorfully evocative tapestry that conjures the imagery of long ago but feels just as current as anything from the present musical landscape all the while sounding like little else on today's airwaves. Across the album's moody and atmospheric tracks Sora's heartrending soprano glides like a graceful dove through swirling mists of violin, piano, harp, synthesizer, cello, guitar, percussion, and other instruments to deliver sweeping performances. The music moves from lightness of thought and sound to richly dense soundscapes. The music is not easy to categorize, but ultimately it is about the journeys we make within ourselves.\n\nIt feels at times as if music comes not so much from within me but that is passes through me in the ways of half-remembered dreams. Yet, I feel we each are a filter to the heart of the world, we shape it, to some extent with our own experiences, perceptions and feelings. I like to think of each of these songs as filtered through my own heart, as water passes through a teabag, colored with the pieces of me. The music itself washes through me, as wind passes through the trees, but in doing so is imprinted by my spirit as it exits through my voice, my fingers, through the notes that I write. The songs are not about me, but I cannot deny that I find myself in them.\n\nIt is my belief that we are influenced by the environments in which we live. The outer world interacts with the inner, affecting thought patters, creation and consciousness. Found within the pages here are objects from my environment; that which creates the spaces I inhabit musically, emotionally, spiritually and physically. Leaves, petals, rocks, crystal; these are the heartgifts I wish to share with you.\n\nHeartwood is the core, it is the truths we carry, it is the place of secret whisperings, it is our beginnings and endings. It is the axis upon which our lives spin. It is my most humble hope that perhaps as these songs pass through you, that you will find something of yourself within them as well.\n\nHeartwood is an examination of the places the heart inhabits.\n",

    "description": "With one eye on the history of recorded music and the other on its future, Sound of Seventy Three's self-titled debut is an experiment in technology, economy, and fidelity that results in a genre-jumping album which still seamlessly comes together as a whole.\n\nBridging the gap between Post-Rock and Electronica, Sound of Seventy Three manage to find the commonality between the two genres placing long-form post-rock right next to trip-hop influenced remixes without either sounding out of place. The original tracks are often guitar-driven instrumental pieces in the best post-rock tradition making full use of the electric guitars' immense range to craft dynamic-cinematic music that demands to be listened to. The remixes on the other hand explore the sound of recoded media as a subtle form of musical expression with noise like tape hiss, vinyl dust, and digital artifacts being intentionally added to the music to add 'color' and 'shade' to the remix of each track.\n\nInspired as much by the 'Lomo' toy-photography movement, as by 'gadget-music', Sound of Seventy Three also explore the musical expressiveness of what many would consider 'toy' instruments. Some of these instruments include the Stylophone, Stylophone Beatbox, Korg Kaossilator and Vox AmPlugs. Amazingly the resulting music is neither comedic, campy, or kitschy and instead has a gravity and intimacy that proves that you can make 'real' music with these new affordable musical tools. Just like your favorite mix-tape Sound of Seventy Three is a collection of music that defies easy categorization and yet is all the better for it.\n",

    "description": "\"The Way We Feel\" is a return to the music that gave birth to unique retro/rock/lounge genre that is Sound of Seventy Three.\n\nNearly half the album: A Farewell; The Great Rest; Ahh, Tow Bots; and Spilt Milk are songs that were gigged with the live-band back when Sound of Seventy Three were playing shows in the Atlanta area in the mid to late 00s as a two-guitar, bass and drums quartet. Some of the material on the album even dates all the way back to 2004. The other half of the album are mostly tunes that were written or started at that time but never finished or incorporated into the live sets. Only one song 'Jyuu' is a completely new composition which also has the distinction of being the longest track on the album.\n\nThe result is an album that is sure to please old fans of the live-band as well as newer fans who have fallen in love with So73's guitars-meet-gadgets approach to the last album. Unlike the first Sound of Seventy Three album which was essentially a collection of singles, the songs on this album were chosen specifically to fit together well stylistically but also to take the listener on a sonic journey when listened to together.\n\nThe album opens with 'Shields' (dedicated to Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine) which is rock minimalism at its finest. The whole song being a simple three note melody on one chord that slowly builds to a noise-filled shoegaze nirvana. The volume and the noise level drop with the restrained yet intense 'A Farewell' which features Doug's distinctive use of the Ebow - an electronic bow that allows you to sustain a note on the guitar indefinitely. However things quickly ramp up again with 'Variations' which has a one-note bass groove that gives it an incessant almost bolero-like quality.\n\nThis is followed by the loud-then-soft-then-loud-again dynamics of 'The Great Rest' where the melody is carried by the bass-guitar; a distinguishing feature of much of Sound of Seventy Three's music. Next come two tracks that build gradually, each more intensely than the last. 'The First Waltz' starts with some gentle arpeggios and lap-steel volume-swells that slowly build until finally it climaxes with tremolo picked guitar, lap-steel, and Stylophone all playing the melody in unison. 'You Say Today, I Say Tomorrow' opens with a chiming guitar riff and beautiful melody to slowly build instrument by instrument, pedal by pedal, to an almost orchestral crescendo at the end. Things get calm and quiet again with 'Jyuu' both the longest track on the album and also the most ambient. This is followed by two tracks that again highlight Sound of Seventy Three's distinctive use of the bass-guitar. 'Ahh, Tow Bots' - originally titled 'Autobots' - is an old favorite from the band's live-set and features bass arpeggios played on an Agile Harm 1 Extended Scale Guitar - A Fender Bass VI style instrument that resembles cross between a bass and a baritone guitar. The track ends with that same bass playing full-on distorted chords toward the end. 'Spilt Milk' has the bass again handling the melody and sees a return of Doug's distinctive use of the Ebow to add interest and tension to the melody. Finally the album ends with the gentle and relaxed 'The Way We Feel' where guitar and six string bass double one another playing chord-melody as a delayed Kaossilator adds a gentle rhythmic bed underneath.\n",

With its cascading, yet tightly controled fury, \"Home\" is the culmination of everything they've done so far, and \"Soul Patch\" is another great example of how experimental they can get with structure, without ever losing interest. Their work remains tight and cohesive no matter where they go with it. Most importantly, really good metal has to have both real darkness and real musicianship, and this album has both of these in spades.

We love Eric Braymer's vaguely Celtic guitar line on \"Into You,\" and are thrilled that Art Bernstein was so into it that he stepped away from his typically more restrained/minimalistic style to get really medieval with that one. The cathartic \"Release\" has that really interesting, sine-wave structure that so defines much of Spinecar's music--and both \"True\" and \"Backstabber\" are Spinecar doing what we think they do best--album rocking!\n",

Asymmetric grooves stay low to the ground while Eric Braymer's vocals alternate between soaring and searing. The musicianship here is exceptionally strong throughout and we're especially fans of drummer Art Bernstein's unexpected rhythms and minimailist approach to metal drumming. Recommended tracks include \"Waste Away,\" the fantastic album rocker \"Smoke\" and \"KC Ripoff.\" \"Leech\" is a bit of a miss, but everything else here is great. Check it out!\n",

Bobby D was living in Key West playing music, and happened to be there during Hurricane Ernesto. The Keys were evacuated, but Bobby decided to stay and ride the storm out. He rented a bunch of gear, got some supplies and refreshments, and hunkered down to wait for the arriving storm. During the storm, Stargarden \"FIVE\" was composed and recorded, using 24bit/96K high resoution audio.\n\nWhile the album is quite a bit shorter than most of the other Stargarden releases, \"FIVE\" has a unique sound and feel. Perhaps the act of creating ambient music in the midst of a hurricane helped to make this album a bit different than the other Stargarden albums. This album is the quiet before the storm, as well as the sounds created in the eye of the hurricane.\n\nGive \"FIVE\" a listen...this may well be the most unique and beautiful album by Stargarden yet!\"\n",

More rhythmically savvy and detailed than any of their work to date, IIIhas some great tracks on it and is absolutely perfect workout music. Our favorite Strojovna 7 album.\n",

    "description": "A one man analogue orchestra producing a soundtrack that needs no film.\n\nWhat's that? It's the noise of 16 tireless months in the studio. It's like listening to three decades in the music industry.\n\nIt's also the sound of homemade, hand-welded percussion instruments, without an audible drum. Impressive then, that it's one man and his Mac in Northamptonshire, with two great ears.\n\nHis debut long-player, 16:9, is a soundtrack to the greatest of epics - seamless seconds of breathtaking aural vision. Fleeting sonic supernovas that inspire emotion and command attention, while blending beautifully into the natural world of the listener. Think the exploratory moments of Vangelis' Bladerunner score, here rooted in the instrumentalism so vital to the early 21st Century, and its broad definition of 'popular music'.\n\nBird songs can be heard, punctuating an almost visible landscape, such is the tangible depth to these compositions. Pianos fall gently into background space, as strings, synths and a host of other, often unexpected musical tools combine to create a tragic, heroic and captivating movie in the mind. A road trip on a mass scale, the sombre closing credits of Cherry Blossom Falls offer up Vienna in violin arrangements, while Kaiyu-Shiki transports you to the eponymous Japanese garden, via a thousand crystalised chimes.\n\nDarker moments abound in Memories Lost, as decomposing tape creates a feeling of faded photography and silent, battle-scorched earth. Meanwhile, The Fire Within recounts a town springing into life on a dark winter's morning, as ambient noise becomes hook and then melody. It might seem lazy to reel off disconnected, imagined instances. But then few films have been this vivid in the landscapes and atmospheres they create.\n\nStuart Sweeney has spent countless hours exploring the English countryside surrounding his home and the sounds to be found, and more importantly recorded, therein. But, far from abstract, all 12 tracks offer something reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's cinematic power, blended with the electronic-experimentation of The Heritage Orchestra. And there's something wholly new too. Far from field music, this is a sublime one-man symphony.\n\nAnd that's just what makes this release so inspired. Part contemporary classical, part sound art, all compelling. There's no tunes here, just stories being told, moments getting captured and emotions laid bare. All the while remaining under the control of a technically disciplined musical aficionado. Hear the tracklist individually, or hear it all as one. Either way, from beginning to end, while under Sweeney's spell, you won't be doing much else.\n",

He set his poetry to his favorite fiddle or bagpipe tunes.\n\nReviews include American Record Guide's comments: \"Morris sings with wonderful abandon, never losing control of tone or intonation.

    "description": "Self-described as \"horror-rock,\" Portland, Oregon-based, hard-hitting, heavy rock act Sweet Teen Killing Machine deliver an exhilarating, self-titled full-length. Comprised of ten tracks, the album delivers melodic, yet hard rock, each song the soundtrack to a fictitious horror movie.\n\nSweet Teen Killing Machine make guitar-rock that is as frightening as it is heart pounding. From the supernatural horror of album opener, \"Curse of the Bloodwolf\" and the album's first single, \"City of the Shrieking Dead.\" To the more human terror of \"Virgin White\" and \"New Meat,\" Sweet Teen Killing Machine can only be described as the sound of an insane rock beast that always seem to be chasing you.\n\nIdeally, Sweet Teen Killing Machine wants to create soundtracks to movies; so, while writing soundtracks to fictitious movies, they take a scenario, a scene from a movie they've made up in their heads, and create the ideal soundtrack for it.\n\nOriginally a basement project between friends, jamming and having a good time, Sweet Teen Killing Machine's debut grew out of that. Never meant to release a record, the ten tracks that compile the album came out sounding so powerful; the members of the band couldn't help but release it.\n\nThose that hear their debut full-length will take notice and go, \"more please.\" Again, like the victims and villains in the horror movies they write soundtracks for.\n",

    "description": "J.S. Bach's Flute Sonatas and Partita were chosen for this album as they were particularly well suited to capturing the sound and atmosphere of the hall in its pre-renovation state. Sonate h-moll fur Flote und obligates Cembalo BWV 1030 is played here with flute and cembalo without basso continuo. Partita a-moll fur Flote allein BWV 1013, known in the only surviving 18th-century manuscript as 'Solo pour une flote traversiere par J. S. Bach' is for unaccompanied flute. Sonate e-moll fur Flote und Basso Continuo BWV 1034 and Sonate E-dur fur Flote und Basso Continuo BWV 1035 are played with cembalo and basso continuo, and in this album, the basso continuo part is realized with a viola da gamba.\n\nThe recording is carefully designed to record not only the sound of the instruments but the ambient sound of the old hall using a highly sensitive one-point stereo microphone system, a specially-tuned tube amp, and a high-precision clock system. The high standard mode (96 kHz, 24 bit) and the folding of full information into CD format enable the listener to appreciate the hi-fidelity sound and precise nuances in performance.\n\nTakashi Matsuishi plays J. S. Bach Flute Sonatas and Partita, recorded at the Hakodate City Community Centre 2011. This album provides a record of Hakodate City Community Centre Hall's unique acoustic qualities. The hall was built in 1933 in the old part of the city and used not only for various lectures and meetings but also as a concert hall. In the later part of the twentieth century, it fell into disrepair, neglect and was sadly used less and less frequently until it was eventually forgotten. Flautist Takashi Matsuishi rediscovered the hall, noting its qualities as worthy of renovation and, since 2007, he has revived its usage by producing a matinee concert series and promoting its unique properties. The hall's renewed popularity with audiences and the media interest in its revival led to a decision by Hakodate City Council to pursue its renovation, bringing its facilities up to modern standards.\n",

Like a character who appears in a sequel or a repeating line in a poem, the teslim invokes a feeling of returning home. For Flexer and Hegedus, creating this music has given them a deep sense of coming home both personally and musically.\n\nThese two composers have been profoundly moved and inspired by the power of traditional Greek, Turkish, Arabic, Jewish and Balkan musics. Flexer and Hegedus listen to, study and perform repertoire from these traditions with reverence and respect. In their work as composers, they are searching for their own voice - one that takes inspiration from tradition and follows where it leads.\n\nThey feel fortunate to have found in one another a kindred spirit who shares a common artistic vision. For them, the recurring theme, the teslim, is that the trust they have in one another musically has allowed them to both commit and surrender to their own individual voices, hopefully creating something larger than either one of them. It is their wish that this voice reaches into you and that you are inspired to continue the cycle of beauty and hope.\n\nMusicians featured on Teslim:\nKaila Flexer - violin, viola\nGari Hegedus - lauoto, baglama, bulgari, divan, cura, lavta, oud, tarhu, frame drum, penny whistle\nShira Kammen and Julian Smedley - fiddles\nOlov Johansson - nyckelharpa\nLiza Wallace - harp\n",

All too often this music is spoilt by the uneven results and almost invariable rivalry stemming from the partnership of a soprano with a counter-tenor. Neither Rachel Elliott nor Sally Bruce-Payne is over-assertive or over-eager to take centre stage, much preferring to preserve the penitential context of the piece and the ethereal beauty of the music ... In short, no rival version that I have heard on disc, and there are several, matches this one. Well-judged tempos and an ideal recorded sound set the seal on a particularly satisfying issue.

Bach join hands in this much-loved dance form of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Of the few works of Philipp Heinrich Erlebach that survive, we perform a suite that concludes with a chaconne. The two Bach cantatas are contrasting: BWV 150 is said to be Bach's earliest surviving cantata, BWV 78 was composed in Leipzig at the height of his career.\n\nRachel Elliott - soprano\nClare Wilkinson - alto\nNicholas Mulroy - tenor\nMatthew Brook - bass\nNicolette Moonen - violin\nRodolfo Richter - -violin\nAnne Schumann - violin / viola\nRachel Stott - viola\nAlison McGillivray - cello\nElizabeth Bradley - double bass\nMarion Moonen - flute\nJames Eastaway - oboe\nCatherine Latham - oboe\nAlastair Mitchell - bassoon\nSilas Standage - organ / harpsichord\n\n\"There's something about the openness of sound, the sheer quality of music-making and the sense of connection between performers and composers that makes this a very special recording. Its contents explore the world of the Baroque chaconne, a secular dance form that became a staple of music for the concert room and chapel. The challenge of creating a piece above a repeated bass line certainly appealed to Bach, Purcell and the little-known Erlebach, each on inspired, inventive form in the works offered here.

German but of Scottish ancestry, it was he who introduced both styles to Germany. Also included are Rebel's homage to Lully and Couperin's to Corelli.\n\n\"This is the most enjoyable programme of seventeenth-century chamber music I have heard in a long time. The recording manages to capture the strings in gutty rather than silvery detail so we relax and enjoy the music without suffering from steel-string fatigue.

Both cantatas open with a chorus in the shape of a French overture: in no. 61 it's the slow introduction that incorporates phrases of the chorale, whereas in no. 97 the singers don't enter until the Vivace. The Erlebach piece, published in 1693, consists of a French overture followed by the usual suite of dances. The other theme of the disc is Heinrich Isaac's 'Innsbruck ich muss dich lassen', heard as a vocal quartet and as instrumental fantasias by Christian Hollander and Paul Lutkeman; and, lo and behold, it's the very tune that becomes the chorale melody at the beginning and end of 'In allen meinen Taten'. ... Nicolette Moonen plays brilliantly, as she does in the tenor aria of no. 97, with its roulades and double-stopping. Even if you don't like Bach sung one-to-a-part, you can't fail to enjoy these performances.\"\nRichard Lawrence - Gramophone, December 2010\n\n* IRR Outstanding disc (November 2010)\n* BBC Radio 3, CD Review Disc of the Week (December 2010)\n",

Original tune compositions include 'reggae reels' - a blend of reggae and traditional reels - 'Gandhi's Triumph' (with its delightfully syncopated rhythms) and 'The Very Hairy Rasta Fairy' and Brian Gilligan singing the laid back 'You Got to Laugh' and 'The United Mistakes of America' (complete with Hillbilly banjo and reggae beat).\n\nThe lineup features Northern Irishman Jarlath Henderson, one of the finest exponents of the uilleann pipes in the World, he is a talented and versatile musician who also plays, low whistle, tin Whistle, flute and cittern in addition to having a fine voice. He regularly guests with Scottish bands Capercaille, Salsa Celtica and Phil Cunningham. Martin MacDonald from Lewis also features on guitar and his performances on \"Good People\" and \"Raggle Taggle Reggae\" in particular, are highlights of the album. Tom Roche from Cork, (Accordion) also features on some tracks with his \"Sliabh Luachra\" style and Egyptian Aly Salam features on drums and percussion.\n",

    "description": "Grey Mirrors is the second album from the unique and groundbreaking the glimmer room. It builds on what has gone before but this time the atmosphere is everything. A gentle bird song beckons you into the piece and what follows is a 42 minute, epic journey though layers of time and emotion.\n\nThe glimmer room's strengths lie in the ability to present supremely melodic structures within a work with such emotional depth. In some passages you are cocooned in a warm luminescence, feeling safe and untouchable as lush choral washes wrap around you. Then the mood changes and you are thrown into an unsettling, barren and misty landscape where you are confronted by the sinister scraping of digital bits and bytes being smashed around a processor. As urgently as it arrives it is gone and you are left floating, clarified in a place of great beauty.\n\nHeralded as the new benchmark for the chill out album, Grey Mirrors is almost a meditation. But every journey is as individual as the listener.\n\nThe ambience of the piece has been likened to the long grandiose intros of Pink Floyd with the overpowering Englishness of John Foxx's Cathedral Oceans. While musically comparisons range from Leftfield's Melt, the KLF's Chill Out, to the more chilled tracks from The Future Sound of London. Add to this a sprinkle of sound design from Delia Derbyshire and you will be close to the sound of this unique album.\n",

It uses multiloop based systems similar to the systems of Brian Eno to build up the basic tracks before the more melodic elements where produced. This provided the machines the space they needed to breath and throw up some truly intriguing avenues that would not have been explored with a more conventional approach to the composition. Slow long ambient loops that always develop and mutate underpin the melancholic washes of sound and melodies.\n\nIn essence it is the album where the machines finally have became true friends. \"I Remain\" is an album presented as one continuous piece of music but split into 9 discrete movements.\n",

At one point in the evening he was asked, \"what happened to all the tracks that never made it onto your albums?\" he explained that a fair few had been used on magazine cover disks and compilations, but it started him thinking about all those pieces of music, six years worth of tracks spread all over the globe. What chance did people have of hearing all of them? With this thought still fresh in his mind, the next day he started to find all the old masters. Over the next few weeks he worked on mastering them and finding a running order that ran like an album and not just a collection of pieces.\n\nWhile he was working on this he started to get the feeling that he was bringing them all back home, safe under one roof. Now We Are Six contains a vast mixture of rare studio, live and re-mixed tracks, giving the listener a chance to hear some of The Glimmer Room's most obscured from view, but totally inspired and atmospheric moments to date, in one sitting.\n",

With dazzling vocals, fantastic bass work, and studio voodoo that's just completely off the hook, it doesn't sound like anything else out there. \"Linda Morena\" is the graceful, near-a cappella intro, and things proceed to get more and more interesting after that. \"Jetuton Andawai\" sounds like a Bollywood record being played backwards to Peter Gabriel, and \"Lost World\" is even more trippy, with tumbling, echoey loops and driving bass. \"Manu Yu\" has a mellow yet infectious groove, and the excellent \"Copeuse Concon\" combines future-classical Indian vocals with smoky jazz. None of the influences here seem like they should work together (islandy xylophones in a blues track?), but they not only succeed, they succeed wildly for a potent, totally unique sound. \"Yesterday\" is the most radio friendly track on the album, with pretty vocals by Sigrid Havercamp. But in true Headroom fashion, most of the vocals of Jetuton Andawai are shaped and manipulated to the point where they form new, never before heard languages.

Der Fahrende Wahnsinn.\n\nIt is that moment in time and place when the soul catches a slow motion glimpse of itself traveling willy-nilly through the maelstrom of the great vortex. At once noble and base, it is coloured in a chromatic blue melancholy and dry red pathos. There too is the peace that comes with acceptance of one's fate... and the anguished impossibility of not struggling against this same fate... La Follia Itinerante holds up a mirror that we may see ourselves as we really are: beggars before God. And makes us laugh at our own pitiful and ludicrous condition.\n\nA true Follia is unique at each playing. It exists for a moment and then vanishes. This one was caught on a warm and sunny afternoon in a garden house on the southern slopes of the Schwarzwald. It takes as inspiration the Follias of Nicholas Chedeville, Corelli, Vivaldi, Marais and the many other composers, known and unknown, who have added to our treasure store of Follias.\n",

    "description": "CRISIS is the brain child of Los Angeles based artist Ajax Garcia and NEWSTED drummer Jesus Mendez Jr.\n\nDuring The Napoleon Blownaparts US tour stint supporting KISS and WEEZER back in 2001 the band had plans to record their long awaited followup to their 1998 album \"Thrill Hype\" but due to conflicting schedules plans to record were put on hold as drummer Jesus Mendez Jr. had prior commitments to his other band NEWSTED (see Jason Newsted of METALLICA).\n\nMendez and Ajax along with new recruit Eric Griffin (MURDER DOLLS) on bass guitar finally entered the studio to begin tracking but because of musical differences the band never got passed the recordings of just two cover tracks with Griffin as part of the line up. The two tracks that were recorded were ultimately released as part of Jetboys Of Babylon (a tribute to The New York Dolls album) which featured David Johansen himself and Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols. Ajax, Mendez and Griffin contributed a blistering version of the Dolls classic Puss In Boots.\n\nGriffin's replacement was bassist Doug Wellmon a young punk rocker from Hollywood California and a former member of the band Pipedown.\n\nWhen the two musicians finally began tracking they recruited a number of musicians to guest on what would become the CRISIS album including legendary blues musicians John Clifton on Harmonica and the legendary Edward Burke on piano. The 70 year old Edward Burke also played with the Ike and Tina Turner Review in the 1970's. Long time friend and guitarist Jessie Farnsworth also of NEWSTED completed the line up and CRISIS was finally released in 2010. AMERICA'S TIRE company used the opening track HELL YEAH as part of their national advertising campaign and the UK CLASSIC ROCK MAGAZINE picked up on the second single MY SPACE PICTURES for their tribute to Guns N' Roses insert Sons Of Guns.\n\nSonically CRISIS is a raw mix of punk rock and garage rock and roll with heavy doses of soul and the blues. Drawing influences from the likes of The Rolling Stones, New York Dolls, The Stooges and heavy tip of the hat to Chuck Berry the CRISIS album takes you on a dark trip down a seedier side of Hollywood California not advertised to tourists.\n\nThe classic slash and burn guitars, frantic drumming under the impressive vocal range of guitarist/vocalist Ajax Garcia make up this low-fi gem.\n\nRecognized for his powerful, raw, biting but truthful commentary on our cultural and social condition, Ajax' work on the song \"Hedonistic Babies\" resonates on every level! Garcia is a post postmodern rarity of authentic swagger and angst, continually serving up his Fresno-born and Hollywood-bred artistry on his own terms.

With the exception of the opening track, the originally lyric-free track \"The Supermachine Looks Much Bigger on TV,\" this collection of songs focuses on a non-vocal soundscape of various moods and timbres. Sometimes playful, sometimes serene, sometimes epic, sometimes melancholic, these tracks are always interesting.\n\nWhen discussing the approach to writing the original album, Proper Authorities' brainchild Keith Adams described its primary theme as \"how time affects our approaches to living... a song about 'You can accomplish anything you want' has more weight and realism to it when you add 'But you'd better step up to the task before it's too late.'\"\n\nThough the words are absent, the urgency and attitude of these songs is still very much present. The hard-edged guitar work and no-holds-barred drums of the track \"Losing The Now\" evokes a feel of a military march with victorious and timely purpose. The electro-rock synth stylings and slinky bass work of \"Make A Choice For Me\" suggest a cold, urban environment and an immediacy of action required. And songs like \"The Ninth Life Jitters\" and \"Whodunit\" are just plain fun rock songs! Enjoy \"Public Service Announcement: Instrumental\"!\n",

This is where we all take a deep breath and wait for August to appear again and again and again and again and again.\n\nVegetables\nSpending thoughts make us forget everything. The notes we save will never be read. You may disagree, but plates don't. Circle around and around the world until we all catch the fever. Let's give the dog a bath. Let's give ourselves a bath. Don't forget to open the envelope before we jump in. This envelope contains the word of the day. Positively, nothing will go as planned. Nowhere can we run. Nowhere can we hide. We water the earth. We water the mouths. Unacceptable.\n\nRules for Animals\nWe weren't suppose to be reasoning with life. We demand rules. No one should go through this. Bitched again and again. Flies are for flying, not dropping. Doors are for opening. Remember readers. Remember the word of the day. Mark it down forever. We are grabbing our belongings and coming for you now.

AVOID.\n\nThe Remaining Idea\nRelaxed, wow, sounds like fresh flowers in the distance. Wait, fresh flowers have sound now. We must have fallen into the trap. Now, we have crossed our hearing and smelling. The heat around us. This gets stronger around Hope Hill. She's one big volcano bursting down some of our huts. We just had another restart. Crawl backflipper star. We feel the energy inside you. Each picture is worth a galaxy\n\nGood Clown, Bad Clown\nThe cartoons keep popping on cue. Look at our costume. Every time the funny friends laugh and joke. While singing to the boring children, We stopped performing miracles years ago. What does this mean? We are being really hard on ourselves. Have another drink and another. Tell the kids to stay away from the ice cream man. He's getting more attention this way. I take pride in what I do, and all this guy does is drive up in a moving shed with wheels with a music box and...... what a loser\n\nThis is Where We Breathe\nSo glad we got away. This is cloud nineteen hundred and twenty thousand that we have counted pass us. Much lower now, everyone has forgotten up to 70 years before this trip. Inhale. Why are we here? Exhale. The wind is changing colors on us. We get on this boat, we drift down this river. Now the upstairs door to the weather can't control us.\n\nSave the New Day\nRush the Riches Cavern. The fun never started. We die. Over the river are alive people. This is where we tell fun lies and truth beyond. Gravity and rocks. Save the sunshine.\n\nI Can Bring You Happiness\nCrease, dent, and polish bad apples. Remind me again to remind me ideas. Remind GOOD people ideas that happiness is correct. Never Fall. Never Fail. Always on time. Correct? Yes. Always happy. Remember forever.\n",

Internationally acclaimed mezzo-soprano Dominique Labelle and three time Grammy nominee Sanford Sylvan lend their incredible voices to the Sarasa Ensemble in order to depict both the idyllic, pagan landscape of the first work, and the luminous, \"lullaby to the soul\" of the second. A third work-Liebster Jesu-features a \"sacred dialogue\" between these two sublime voices, and the entire album makes clear why The Sarasa Ensemble is so often praised for its great clarity of style.\n",

    "description": "Coalizione del Volere, the new album from The Seldon Plan, is a direct descendant of their video sessions - reflective of a desire of the band to step back to a more Dischord-era-like guitar-driven rock sound, akin to 2005's Making Circles but with the softer, more mature edge of 2007's The Collective Now. On Coalizione del Volere, the band seems intent on exploring a more angular guitar rock sound within the context of focused melodies and textured intricate harmonies.\n\nListeners who have enjoyed The Seldon Plan through their first four records will delight as The Big Takeover has at the \"...Baltimore foursome's continued maturation.\" To this end, the band presents a mature Seldon Plan sound, an amalgam of influences that can be heard but do not define Coalizione del Volere. The use of strong and repeatable melodies is reminiscent of the American Analog Set, yet the technicolor layers of Coalizione del Volere bring to mind Let Go-era Nada Surf and The Californian by Sunday's Best. To drive home this past/present dichotomy The Seldon Plan has teamed up again with engineer Frank Marchand (The Thermals, Bob Mould), who worked with the band on 2005's Making Circles, and 2007's The Collective Now.\n",

    "description": "These three EPs, combined into an album, each shows different sides of the rock/prog/electro-rock sound that is The Town Monster. Each EP explores a different musical concept.\n\nThe three shorts from the April EP are almost entirely electronic and feature a much snappier, more polished sound than the previous EPs. This one treads bizarre yet poppy territory, coming off like a Burlesque/New Wave mashup of Radiohead and Faith No More. \"Atari Girl\" is a raging beast of a track with multiple layers of bass, synth choirs, and some demented big top rapping. \"Stay 4 Tha Night\" is a song about being seduced by the devil and features some impressive synth fondling. The final, moody track, \"Meet Me in the Forest\", was used for the band's first foray into music video and animation, which became a large part of their work in the future. By April the band had realized they couldn't stay in the warehouse for a prolonged period of time and found a new headquarters at Electraplay Studios in Hilliard, Ohio.\n\nThe May EP sounds a bit like the band has spring fever. The production is brighter and bits of sunshine are beginning to peek through. The arrangements are lighter, too: the main instruments in these numbers are acoustic and electric piano and banjo. The first track is mysteriously titled \"The Town Monster (Part Two)\" and tells a story of an angel who comes to earth and warns the townspeople to repent...to which they promptly reply by burning him at the stake. By this point it is apparent that the band has grown comfortable taking risks with their music and their presentation of it, but also confident enough to write low-key, folk-inspired songs like the closing track \"Onward\", one of the best in their catalogue.\n\nDefinitely an oddball of the group, the June EP saw The Town Monster in a transitional period. This was to be the last they recorded with their excellent former bass player Mike Rana and he is featured heavily here, practically taking lead duties on the only instrumental song in the collection, \"1 A.M.\". This EP is deep, dark and groovy...syrupy, even. All three are tinged with hip hop beats and further experimentation with pitch-shifted and auto-tuned vocals. The closing track \"Oil\" was written the day after the historic BP oil spill and wound up being one of the band's angriest, most unique and most universal songs. It helps that it features fantastic lead guitar work by Rob Bradley of Sleepers Awake, as well as samples of the late Professor Longhair, a creole pioneer of rock and roll.\n",

    "description": "Ohio Sessions (January EP)\nIn the middle of snowy January 2010, The Town Monster announced on their MySpace page (yes, bands had those back then) that they would be putting out an EP on the last day of every month for the whole year. Shockingly, they did...and it's actually good.Recording and releasing a 44-song collection month by month month over the course of a year and in many locations would be a daunting task for any band. Nevertheless, while facing several lineup changes amidst relentless live performances, The Town Monster managed to churn out these bite-size albums one at a time, spanning numerous genres and managing to find their own particular sound in the process. The January EP begins with a brief acoustic tribute to their midwestern home before going straight into electropop territory. It ends with in icy piano ballad over glitched-out drum loops and orchestra samples, hinting at the numerous styles to come.\n\nOhio Sessions (February EP)\nThe February EP eventually became one of The Town Monster's most popular releases, and opening track \"Raincloud\" became a staple of their live show. On the remaining three tracks they begin toying with song structure and instrumentation, making use of 808s, banjos, pitch-shifted vocals, wind, rain, and samples from a song by the now-defunct Columbus band Burglar. \"Birds and Bees are Natural Enemies\" starts off almost sweetly, but the storm clouds make an ominous return, and by the end you are drowning in a flood of synthesizers. \"Mongrel\" is the band's best attempt yet at their own blend of mad circus rock. Although it serves the Ohio Sessions well, this EP stands out as a gem of its own.\n\nOhio Sessions (March EP)\nMarch of 2010 saw the Monster in need of a new cave, and they temporarily found themselves in a dilapidated warehouse with no heat...and an EP to record if they were going to stay true to their word. According to the band, they could \"see their breath during practice\" and they would \"record until their hands froze and they were forced to seek shelter\". The recordings reflects the harsh conditions of their birthplace...they are abrasive and drenched in a metallic natural reverb from the giant open space they were taped in. Close listening reveals trains going by in the distance. The songs themselves are traditional/blues/hard rock at first glance, but the band's myriad influences still peek through with bits of melotron, destroyed keyboard, and ukulele. Vocally, this EP finds singer Nathan Photos becoming more comfortable in his own shoes, and these performances, which are mostly concerned with poverty and violence, sound scathing and desperate. This is Ohio rock at its finest.\n",

    "name": "Ohio Sessions, July to September",
    "description": "Ohio Sessions (July EP) - Once again, the band did a 180 and released three songs featuring acoustic guitars and almost all major chords. It is bouncy and up-tempo, even featuring a song called \"Summertime\" that might be the closest they have yet come to straight-up pop music. The other two, \"For Your Love\" and \"Why Does it Have to Hurt?\" both come off sappy and sweet due to their Motown/traditional rock vibe, but the whole set are actually quite somber in their content. By the end you realize this is plastic, Lego sunshine and it can't possibly last. And in that sense, the band captured the fleeting beauty and the essence of Summer in the best way a (typically) dark electronic rock band possibly could.\n\nOhio Sessions (August EP) - Although this EP is a personal favorite of mine, there are arguably no \"standout\" tracks in this bunch. Instead, the band is more focused, quieter. You can finally begin to see them trying to adopt a \"less is more\" attitude, and the songs flow together quite well, despite the usual genre-hopping. \"The Silver Thread\" and \"I Am The Forest Floor\" (which feature the band's usual drummer Matt Grady on acoustic guitar) have a transcendent, otherworldly quality about them and frankly sound unlike any other band. Of course they bear resemblances to countless artists, but these songs, despite their flaws, are unmistakably and undeniably The Town Monster and no one else. The album closes with a gorgeous indie-style piano ballad that sounds like a tip of the hat to The Doves or The Autumns. It's a bittersweet kiss goodbye to the summer, and a surprising EP from a band full of surprises.\n\nOhio Sessions (September EP) September wound up becoming the most popular of the Ohio Sessions EPs and it's easy to see why. \"One Thousand Wolves\" became one of the band's most beloved songs, garnering heavy local radio play on CD102.5. \"Dirty Little Secrets\", with its cheesy church organ and steadily-picked bass could have been plucked straight from an 80's album if it weren't so strangely modern. This is music for vampires who also happen to love Bruce Springsteen. The closing track, \"Pawn Shop\", was the only song out of all 44 released during the Ohio Sessions that the band posted by itself on their Facebook page and said, \"Listen to this one, it's good.\" Their first real venture into industrial music, it manages to feel like an old Sneaker Pimps or Massive Attack song with overdubs by Mars Volta and hints of, dare I say it...black metal? Whatever you want to call it, this was the point when people realized this band was not like other bands.\n",

    "description": "Ohio Sessions (October EP)\nBy now the boys seemed to have hit their stride, and they released this EP ahead of schedule so people could have it for Halloween, appropriately. It is commonly, mistakenly referred to as \"The Halloween EP\". These are the darkest songs in the collection, filled with lyrics about ghosts, possessed dolls, skeletons and witches and put to a soundtrack of smashed pianos, theremins, screaming, layers of shrieking guitars, thunderous drum machines crammed in the middle of real drums, and more screaming. This was the only EP the band recorded \"live\" in the studio, which even most non-musicians realize isn't very common nowadays. Although there are overdubs, it is apparent that it was recorded quickly and furiously. They can barely contain their energy, and it is most obvious at moments like the end of \"Paper Boats, Paper Ghosts\", which would almost sound like Black Sabbath if they weren't tripping over each other in their mania, or the climactic buildup toward the end of \"B1G WH00P1N' 5K3L3T0N5 (I'm Not Guilty Anymore)\" when all the disparate pieces finally come together in a lovely, relieving crescendo to let you know the nightmare is over.\n\nOhio Sessions (November EP)\nIt is the general consensus that the November EP left a lot of newcomers wondering if this was the still the same band from last month. Leaving all the neon lights and loud noises behind, they retreated back to pianos and banjos and released one of their most accomplished (and again one of their most understated) albums. With the exception of \"The Glow\" and its incessant drum machine, 90's guitar and Bjork-esque bells, these songs are gentler, more thoughtful, and more emotional. \"The Coward\" is one of their most mature works and proves there's some really good musicians buried under all those electronics. At this point, they sound like a band completely devoted to challenging themselves, and to constantly evolving.\n\nOhio Sessions (December EP)\nWhen The Town Monster saw the finish line for this project, they knew they had to end it with a bang, and so they did...but not before they released a 25-minute animated Christmas special (yes, of course it's a musical!) in which they suffer the toils of being a local rock band, join a superhero group called The Shadow League of Rock and Roll Defenders of the World, and battle a dragon (of course). The December EP is a much more serious affair and is probably the best of the bunch. Yes, this is the same band it was twelve months ago, but their recordings became significantly more refined over that course of time, as did their songwriting, and it is a fascinating journey. After the sweeping eleven minute epic that is merely titled \"(/)\", the listener is left with what we now realize was the missing second half of \"Ohio\", the first song from the January EP. It is a touching moment as Photos starts listing off the things that \"will always make his heart explode\", and those things turn out to be a lot of the things he's been singing about all along. These twelve albums are not without the occasional misstep; indeed, many times it is the sound of a band trying something new and they don't have sure footing. You also get the feeling that, sometimes, they had a lot more work they wanted to do, but it was the end of the month, and it was time to move on. But it is this scrapbook quality that makes the Ohio Sessions a far more successful documentary of a band than a film could hope to be. As far as I'm aware, The Town Monster are the only artists that have done a project like this, and something magical was captured here. If every band worked this hard and took this many chances, the world would be a pretty different place.\n",

It's a hybrid of noisecore and drum 'n'bass, but with really smart rhythms and a noise-ambient wash that lends a huge amount of atmosphere and depth. There's a really satisfying level of sonic texture on Cyst too; the juxtaposition of totally glitched out, ever-changing beats with the eerie ghost calls and dystopian waveforms in the background works really well. The opener \"Turned\" and \"Do You\" are great, \"This is Terror\" is beautifully brutal, and we absolutely love\"Feel The Burning.\"\n",

    "description": "This album includes 5 main tracks (Tamuke, Sokkan, Shingetsu, Choshi, Daha) composed mostly by unknown Fuke monks who played each piece during meditation.\n\nAfter careful and repeated listening of these pieces, the spirit of each one reached deep into the soul of both listener and player, making it possible to imagine the various improvisations of bumblebee sound, ostinato, a simple melodic bass pattern matching the shakuhachi monody, like the early practices that appeared successively in the Western music history, going from modal structures to polyphony. The choice once made, gave rise to quite a natural voice, guided by the addition of bass lines while preserving the shakuhachi part in its entirety.\n\nThe voice is here utilized as an instrumentally, illustrating a quote from Rudolf Steiner: \"The pure song should delete every word\" In addition to the five main shakuhachi classics, other tracks are divided between improvisations, reappropriation and composition:\n\n1. Tamuke \"Ta\" means hands, \"Muke\" means facing each other, or hands put together, which indicates solidarity within oneself and one's community. In solidarity we experience unity and in unity we experience transition and movement of energy from one body to another. This piece is played to commemorate the transition from one phase to another. It is also a eulogy and a requiem for the departed souls of loved ones. It is a melody that brings indescribable stillness deep into the heart.\n\n2. While High - Improvisation\n\n3. Sokkan - This piece can be translated as \"breath-sight\". It is played as a meditation and observation of the process of breathing the most essential human activity. When breath is observed, respected, and self-controlled, harmony and peace begin.\n\n4. Transcend to Void - Improvisation\n\n5. Shingetsu - \"Shin\" indicates the heart, the mind, and the spirit. \"Getsu\" indicates moon. The moon is symbolic of enlightenment and one's discovery of the truthful and sincere pathway in life. There is a certain level of effort that one must exert in order to cultivate, toil and refine diligently one's excellence and purity in mind, body, and spirit.\n\n6. Secret - Improvisation\n\n7. Tsukikusa - Improvisation\n\n8. Choshi - \"Cho\" is refers to \"searching\", and \"Shi\" is refers to oneself. This piece is played to allow the player to tune to the instrument and the surrounding. It is the joining of Mind/Spirit/Instrument at the beginning of each meditation session.\n\n9. Morning mist - Improvisation\n\n10. Greensleevses - traditionnal English (Henry VIII)\n\n11. Daha - \"Da\" means to tear apart, to break and to strike, \"Ha\" means wave. The striking waves along the seashores are a symbol of the infinite adversities that we need to overcome in our daily lives. Yet, the constant pounding of the waves along the sea rocks provides a constant process of cleansing and rejuvenation. Daha is played for the increased will power, humility, and determination to overcome those adversities. A peaceful dream\n\n- Kyle Kamal Helou\n",

It's their melodies in particular that make it clear that Thursday Group is not simply re-heating a bunch of jazz tropes; they're finding a musical path together.

    "description": "\"Music from the edges of Islamic civilization,\" is how the incredibly talented multi-instrumentalist Tim Rayborn describes The Path Beyond, an assortment of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic instrumental music from medieval Spain, North Africa, Turkey, Iran, and the Balkans. This decidedly pre-modern has a gloriously acoustic sound. Tim, and will transport you not only to other worlds, but to another time within those worlds. Tim is known for his exceptionally great production values and attention to detail, so his music has this clean yet warm, sensual sound that falls very gracefully on the ears. Five of these songs are of historical and traditional origin, while the others are improvisations or compositions that \"reflect the spirit of ancient heritage.\" Simply great. Pick it up today.\n",

The intimate focus of a single source of music provides a distinctly non-Western listening experience; the word \"Qadim,\" in fact, is an Arabic one referring to music performed in an \"old style\", and according to traditional concepts. Two of the works here are among the oldest known written music: two songs from Ancient Greece invoke the muses, and there's a 3,500-year-old hymn to the Babylonian moon goddess Nikkal. Beautiful work, as usual, from the deeply talented Tim Rayborn.\n",

The eldest, Goltraiges, was born in great pain to her. The second, Gentraiges, was born with joy. The birth of the third, Suantres, caused her great fatigue. These boys grew up to become master harpers and their styles, or strains, were said to be derived from the manner of their birth: the goltrai (the strain of weeping), the geantrai (the strain of happiness), and the suantrai (the strain of sleep). It was these styles which harpers were expected to master and invoke in their audiences.\n",

A dark world of drug-fueled visions which takes us on an emotional soundtrack to a science-fiction movie, a blending of mechanical and organic worlds, depressive, sad and cyberpunky.\n\nEach track pulls us through a swath of visions and emotions. From the tough, rugged break-beats of \"Th\" which evolves through soaring atmospheres into a trance/industrial epic, to the plaintive keystrokes on \"Pa\", which compliment the bottom-heavy flow nicely. Hardcore returns with \"No\" and \"Np\" and then morphs into the funky clicks and chirps of \"Pu\". An introspective, rainy day ambiance of \"Am\", descends to the seething dark-rave of \"Bk\". \"Cf\" climbs to happy hardcore territory, before grabbing your guts for a booming and vital, \"Fm\" which transforms into archetypical dark-rave once its own break-beat pacing cuts in. The album ends with tracks lilting to the more ambient side of Tokee such as the ominous and spiritual \"Md\" and then the ethereal, badly hallucinogenic \"Lr\". We warned you...\n",

The musicians came into the studio unsuspecting, not knowing the material at all, from a variety of folk, roots, jazz, rock, pop and classical backgrounds.\n\nThere was no plan, only an unfolding of the previously undiscovered, until the album became what it is.

They join perfectly with the music to take you into Tom's world. It's a world where you can relax with your mate on a sunny afternoon in the park, or risk everything for love. It's also a world where our obsessions and compulsions can have us tossing and turning at night looking for a way out of a mess. But even in the worst days, we sense that Tom believes there is the possibility of redemption if we are only will to try.\n\nTom teams up with drummer Charlie Morgan to present tight pop-rock numbers. His friend, Ralph Edgar, contributed lyrics to the song about a Monongahela River Barge called the \"Annie B Wilson\". Danie Paul, his son, sang harmonies on \"Eagle over 79\" which is about a real life experience of seeing Bald Eagles returning to Tom's native Western Pennsylvania.

On the song cloud, Toni Iniguez flies over the tops of trees in a forest and he pays tribute the great master Johann Sebastian Bach, arranging his cantata and transforming the final into a primal ethereal beat. The album follows rain as you would hear, feel and smell following a dawn looking through the window to the distant mountains.\n",

The songs and melodies contained in this album are made with textures of 6 and 12 classical guitars superimposed, creating organic shapes, and arranged in a rhythmic mix / original melodic.\n\nThe album was composed around the idea of meditation, silence and the beautiful sound of the classical guitar. The songs are arranged carefully to create a sense of silent meditation. The power and intensity of the pieces moving more in the middle of the album suggest we lost in the intoxicating sounds of The Garden.\n\nThe idea for this project was to create an organic blend of hypnotic sounds of meditative and minimalist music with the most beautiful instrument that exists: the classical guitar. Enter The Garden and observe life around you. You've never heard anything like it. The music of The Garden you will absorb and marvel.\n",

The same goes for the influences. You can sense a bit of a tango atmosphere when listening to \"Black Elegance\", or you might prefer to follow the contemporary development of \"Tribute to Braid\" which was inspired by the soundtrack of the video game \"Braid\". Basically jazz and modern classical music play a major role when it comes to the influences of this album, although they have rather been carefully separated instead of mixed together.\n\nPiano Works is not what you might expect. Some of you might notice that the pieces don't really sound like a piano that has been recorded directly. This is an album that has almost completely been composed with one finger instead of ten. Of course, the sounds you hear do come from a real piano, although the composer of this album has never even seen this piano before. Additionally, the 'notes' do not even look like real notes, although digital composing software that allows one to create a score is widely available and works well, but in this case the notes are simply bars of different length with an associated 'velocity value', and yes, every single track has been created by drawing bars with a mouse. There is no solid style that has been maintained throughout the whole collection.\n",

Literally meaning \"sea of clouds\" in Japanese, the music represents a new, fresh approach in sound design.\n\nThe concept behind Un-Kai is to integrate percussion and electronic music as closely as possible. Not just two layers, an electronic beat with percussion played over it, for example, but the sounds had to blend together in a more organic way. We tried to do so by using all kinds of technical trickery like triggering a vocoder by a Bendir (percussion instrument) or using a convolution sample of a Tabla (instead of a reverb sample) over a drum computer loop. But now we're getting too technical :-) Maybe more importantly than the above, it had to be danceable and an adventure to listen to!\n\nChill out on organic percussive beats, relax on various oriental atmospheres and immerse yourself into this unique sound adventure!\n",

I dont know if its just cause I have been out of contact for a while, but this really just hit the right note with me. The first track (Turismo) is just really trippy and really reminds me of the trancy stuff from the early 90's with a 2007 overhaul. The second track (Orient Stress), which is also featured on the previous release from Vate, has a pulsating tribal rhythm with growling basslines set to a slamming breakbeat. Almost industrial in some aspects. These billowing basslines continue through to the next track which is also a standout track. Hertz drops into a more minimal-IDM style and it slowly progresses into more distorted IDM sounds from here onward. Overall the album is fantastic and its highly recommended.

And in this way it reflects what is so much a part of the northern countries, - light and darkness that show up in such extreme ways.\n\nThe songs have brought these two opposites together for me, letting our dark and light sides exist in the same space, through the tenderness of the lullabye. I hope you will have your own unique experience as you listen to these songs from the land where the days are dark and the nights are light.\n",

    "description": "As Bach emphasized in his own Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, the practice of cello solo combines different meanings: monody and polyphony, tonality and modality, the ancient and the modern.\n\nVito Paternoster's cello is like an expressive universe which doesn't need any accompaniment. It is a great challenge to pull this off.\n\nJ.S. Bach, Partita in D minor - this piece represents the transcription for cello of the renowned Partita in A minor for flute solo (BMV 1013) which Bach composed at the time when he worked at Koetchen Court, and is undoubtedly one of the best period of his life. This is coincident with the Suites for solo cello and with the Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin which represent the highest example of \"stile concitato\".\n\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Sonata in F major for solo cello: this is the transcription for cello of the Sonata for flute and harpsichord in C major, a virtuosic flute masterpiece, for the first time performed by cello .\n\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Sonata in D minor for solo cello: this transcription of the Sonata in A minor for solo flute represents one of the best examples of unaccompanied sonatas.\n\nHeinrich Franz Ignaz Biber, Passacaglia in C minor for solo cello: this is the last of a series of sonatas Biber composed for solo violin (here transcribed for cello), each of them corresponds to one of the Mysteries of the Rosary. The Passacaglia had its origins in a Spanish dance (from the Spanish pasar, to walk, and calle, street; which means to go beyond the limits) and it consists of a series of continuous variations over a bass, with a strong hypnotic power.\n\nVito Paternoster, La Monica: this is a medieval-inspired passacaglia as well, with a set of continuous variations, increasingly arduous and polyphonic.\n\nVito Paternoster, The Spiritual Combat: inspired by the 17th-century homonymous Lorenzo Scupoli's bestseller (it was diffused more than the Bible and became soon a model of living and spiritual education during the Counter-Reformation), this suite starts maintaining a single note (D, that's RE in Italian, a polysemic word meaning also King) representing the Oneness around which a series of themes revolves, both rhythmically and melodically, in order to represent the fickle World.\n",

    "description": "Robert Schumann : \"Unperformable\" the cellist Robert Bockmuehl commented after the rehearsal on March the 23th 1851. Unfortunately, his commentary had a negative influence on record labels Schumann was dealing with: they then rejected every proposal, even the most profitable. Eventually, in November 1853 at Lipsia, the music publisher Breitkopf offered him a deal on condition that his piece should be suitable for public performance. Thence, Schumann thought of transcribing his piece both for violin (as his friend, the violinist Joseph Joachim suggested him) and for cello and string quartet. The orchestral adaptation was completed in 1854 and it was first performed by the orchestra in Moscow 1867 (cello by David Popper). Until then, the orchestral version was just played by the piano or by the string quartet. The present world premiere recording intends both to reproduce the poetics of music composed at that time and to recreate the mood inspired by the Concerto when it was being played between 1850 and 1867 .\n\nRossini : A young lady, a contender's fiancee, hopes her lover could win the great race; anxiety overtakes her until the victory joy. This instrumental transcription enhanced the melodic inventiveness of these emotional songs.\n\nMercadante : The Neapolitan composer wrote his last work when he was already blind. It was dedicated to a friend of his from Capri, a great cello lover.\n\nNiccolo Paganini : Paganini's Variations for the fourth string on the theme from \"Mose\" by Rossini were conceived to be played on one string. It is said that Paganini would, on occasion, intentionally break strings himself during a performance so he could further display his virtuosity. Success was assured.\n",

    "description": "In comparison to the rich legacy of instrumental and vocal music preserved in his cantatas, relatively little chamber music of J.S. Bach survives. Surely there must have been more, as historical accounts suggest a lively musical scene for instrumental music not only from Bach's Cothen period but also but also, as Christoph Wolff suggests in his 1985 article on Bach's chamber music, from his tenure at Leipzig.\n\nThe works which do survive are compositions of extraordinary refinement, and the sonatas for violin, with both continuo and obbligato parts for keyboard, are among the best of Bach's chamber music. Although it is impossible to say for certain if Bach created this new genre, he was certainly the first to write a significant number of complex pieces using this new technique. The quality of these pieces and their position in history is reinforced by a brief note penned many years after their composition by Bach's son, Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach: \"The six harpsichord trios are among my dear father's best works. Even after more than fifty years, they still sound excellent, and are delightful\".\n\nA comparison to the Brandenburg concertos may be drawn not only in the way the sonatas are collected but also in the tightly knit compositional style which emphasizes all of the varied skills of the baroque musician, from cantabile playing to episodes of ferocious complexity and virtuosity.\n\nThe manuscript sources present a number of different titles for these works, but a common thread may be seen in the following: Sei Suonate a Cembalo certato e Violino solo (\"certato\" here means that the keyboard part is written out in full). The title emphasizes the partnership of the harpsichord and violin (with the harpsichord here receiving top billing). The collection of six pieces was numerically significant to Bach, as musicologist John Butt has noted: Bach liked groups of six, and, like the six Brandenburgs, the collection was probably drawn from several different sources.\n\nA number of writers have suggested that owing to the primary position of the word \"cembalo\" and the word \"certato\" in the title, these pieces are really harpsichord sonatas with violin accompaniment. A survey of all the titles in all of the sources reveals that all of the titles are different, and that the pieces are often referred to only as \"violin solo\" or \"violin sonata.\" However, the word \"certato\" in the title does importantly signify a new and exciting development in the composition of instrumental sonatas: a method in which the keyboard player is provided with an intricate, written out part which essentially creates the sound of a trio sonata - the right hand of the keyboard instrument often sounds a melody in the manner of a second solo instrument.\n\nIn addition to the \"obbligato\" sonatas, we have recorded several of the continuo sonatas in which only a bass line with figures is provided for the continuo. Although the accompaniments for these pieces is much less elaborate than those of the obbligato sonatas, it is clear from the figures and the overall musical structure that although a trio-like texture is called for in some places in the music - the figures above the bass notes sometimes provide a basic outline for a counter melody - the harmonic underpinnings work quite well as a solo sonata.\n\nOne of the true delights of preparing this program, and in reading about the history of these pieces, was working with the seldom performed Fugue in G Minor for Violin and Continuo BWV 1026. An unusual piece in many respects, the Fugue combines a number of contrapuntal devices over an imitative and harmonic framework, and, needless to say, requires every ounce of technique from the soloist. Extended episodes of two-part writing are leavened with triple stops and an extended pedal point alternating between the D strings of both the violin and the cello.\n\nOf the Fugue, violinist Carla Moore writes: \"What a wonderful surprise was in store when I opened the score of Bach's complete sonatas for violin and harpsichord, and discovered the G Minor Fugue. I had never come across this work before - it is not in any edition of the sonatas I have seen, and is not part of the standard Bach sonata repertory. It reminded me of the excitement and thrill of discovery I experienced in college when I began performing music by composers not taught in the modern violin curriculum - Biber, Castello and Couperin - and how it changed forever the way I think about music. What a wonderful treat it has been to learn this suspenseful, high-energy piece.\"\n\n~ David Tayler, Ph.D. 2013\n\nFull notes and bios are available in the artwork download or from www.voicesofmusic.org/bachviolin.html.\n",

Jane's book, now 400 years old, contains some of the best English music written for the lute, but this particular piece was from Scotland, and it was music that I had not even imagined could exist: full of spirited dance rhythms, unusual harmonies and angular, asymmetrical tunes.\n\nAt the time, I wished for more of these amazing pieces - enough for a concert of Scottish music, or a recording. In the intervening years, many fine musicians and musicologists found more music, and recorded this repertory, so that Scottish music became an established part of the Early Music repertory.\n\nMore than sixty different manuscripts and prints were consulted in preparation for this recording, and these sources reflect the confluence of international styles in vogue in Scotland in the 17th century. I hope that you will enjoy this music as much as I have.\n\n-David Tayler, Ph.D.\n",

I ended up leaning heavily on dub, traditional folklore (especially Jamaican), and acid sounds.\n\nI found some old Calypso and Mento records and used some sounds from those as textures and loops. Also, I knew I wanted the album to sound kind of \"piratey,\" as it is perhaps the most romantic of all childhood fantasies, and I definitely spent a lot of time thinking about my childhood when my grandfather passed away.\n\nI just wanted the whole thing to sound fun! There's even a sample from a Jamaican Jerk Sauce specialist giving a taste demonstration. Spicy food is the best designer drug!\n\nRegarding the artwork, there are nautical compasses and an old John Speed map of Jamaica blended into the background, and a nice trippy close up of a Black Witch moth blended into the tracklist page of the inlay. There's also a silhouette of a Black Witch moth on the front cover, covering the St. Thomas Parish of the Jamaica map (where the Morant Bay Slave Rebellion occured back in 1865).\n\nIn Jamaican folklore, the Black Witch moth is known as a \"Duppy Bat\". It is said to be an embodiment of a lost soul, or a soul not at rest. The Jamaican National Heroes George William Gordon and Paul Bogle were hanged at Morant Bay by the British authorities for their part in the rallying of the slave workers, who set fire to the Court House and the nearby buildings in anger. They were buried in a shallow grave behind the Court House.\n",

    "description": "\"Assumpta Est Maria\" is a collection of ceremonial vocal music connected to the high feast day of the Assumption of Mary. With Latin plainchant and polyphonic compositions, the sequence is based on the structure of a late medieval mass.\n\nThe music of the proper (lat. proprium), always occasion-specific, contains texts directly relating to the feast held on August 15th. The elements of the proprium include the Introitus, Graduale, Alleluia, Offertorium, and Communio.\n\nThe ordinary (lat. ordinarium) refers to mass elements in which the text is fixed. The Kyrie eleison (track 3) and Gloria (track 4) are taken from Marian masses, while the Sanctus (track 12) and Agnus Dei (track 13) come from other sources. The Agnus Dei, with its three-part trope Lux lucis from a unicum Scottish manuscript, demonstrates the richness of sound in the 13th century. It also functions as a bridge to the three-part Gloria (track 4) tropes from the Burgos Monastery, and to the three- and four-part Notre Dame conductus (track 1,11) Both of the four-part conductus and the two-part Alleluia (track 9) are attributed to the only composers of Notre Dame repertory known by name, Magestri Leonin and Perotin.\n\nOn this recording, the alternation of Gregorian chant and elaborate three-part music creates an effective heightening of intensity within the musical dramaturgy. Providing space for reflection upon the significance of the ritual, the paraliturgic conducti are not part of the order of the mass and thus do not have a specific location within it. Two examples are heard from the monastic Liturgy of the hours of the Assumption of Mary: the Antiphon Quae est ista (track 8), which presents Psalm 113, In exitu Israel, and the 14th century reading, Jube Domine: Consurge induere fortitudine (track 6). The mass concludes with the Benedicamus Domino (track 15).\n\nVOX NOSTRA conducted independent musicological research to produce this recording. All music is performed using original notation, including neumes and modal notation.\n",

    "name": "Vocal music of the Cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris in the year 1200",
    "description": "Vocal music from the Cathedral de Notre-Dame de Paris, anno 1200.\n\nParis, 1163. The construction of the Cathedral Notre-Dame in innovative gothic style was underway. The exactness of proportion was the foundation of both the architecture, as well as the music of the late Middle Ages. The spatial conception found in the architecture of gothic cathedrals was mirrored in new compositional techniques. A layering of up to four individual voices superimposed upon one another is found in the liturgical music of the late 12th century. The art historian Otto von Simson referred to the overwhelming special conception of gothic cathedrals as \"music turned into stone\".\n\nBy the year 1200, the cathedral had become a radiant cultural and academic center. Cathedral and monastery school collegiums were the breeding grounds of academia. At the beginning of the 13th century, 'musica' was taught in the University as one of the seven liberal arts - geometry, arithmetic, music, astronomy, rhetoric, grammar, and dialectic. Music was closely related to the concept of cosmic arrangement in number and proportion, shedding light on the early notion of music as 'audible number', and later as 'numbered sound'. The cathedral school must have been a magnet for general interest as well. Music was performed there, which was not heard anywhere else in Europe. People came in torrents to experience the flourishing of this new incredible music. Performed primarily on high feast days of the church calendar in celebratory and magnificent musical implementation, the music included the use of polyphony. At feasts of the highest liturgical importance, the new vocal compositions could be heard with up to four voices.\n\nThe names of two magistri, Leonius and Perotinus, are known to us today in conjunction this early form of polyphony. They achieved international fame as teachers and cantors in the Seine metropolis . According to the celebrated chronicler Anonymous IV, curious students and clerics traveled to Paris from Italy, England, and Spain, to hear the spectacular new musical art with their own ears, and to study this new compositional technique.\n\nThe impact of this innovation was extraordinary. Imagine the magnificent stained glass windows, creating paintings of light in the gothic church. The church space was also filled with the sound of disembodied voices, as the singing clerics in the presbytery were separated from the laypeople in the nave of the church by a chancel screen made of fabric or carpets. The charisma of these sumptuous and rare church feasts was immense. For a medieval person, the sacred construction of the presbytery had a deeply felt symbolism, the embodiment of 'heavenly Jerusalem'. The celestial sound of the 'laus perhennis', or 'everlasting praise' soared out from behind the chancel screen. If a believer had the chance to hear these musical prayers radiating from such a holy place, sung at times by more than one hundred clerics in such splendor, his or her chance of salvation would certainly improve.\n\nHighly trained clerics and boy singers spent many years of study in order to sing the complex polyphonic music. Boy singers had to pass very stringent singing tests for this purpose. A new repertory with new musical forms was developed in the cathedral schools- organum, conductus, and motet.\n\nIn this time all over central Europe, monumental gothic cathedral buildings were erected. Likewise, the music from Notre- Dame circulated through manuscript copies of the famous Magnus Liber Organi de Graduali et Antiphonario (Book of Graduals and Antiphons). This book is a collection of polyphonic compositions (organa) for parts of the Mass and Divine Office: alleluia, gradual, responsories, and benedicaumus Domino. The beginnings and the verses, which earlier were solistically sung, appeared in a polyphonic vestment. The practice of singing organum, which in early times was a purely improvisational technique, comprised of inventing a second voice to well known chant melody. Until the mid 11th century, the chant melody was found in the upper voice. Later, as in the Notre-Dame repertory, it was found in the bottom voice and was called cantus, tenor, or vox principalis. Magister Leoninus composed exclusively for the Cathedral de Notre-Dame, two-part organa based on Gregorian chant. Magister Perotinus expanded this art with compositions of up to four-parts.\n\nMusic from the Mass, as well as from the Divine Office can be heard on this recording. The musical core consists of organa and conductus from Notre-Dame de Paris in the 13th century, as well as their musical emanations. Gregorian chant from the 10th to the 12th centuries, as well as inserted tropes and sequences from later 14th century sources are grouped according to their function within the Mass.\n",

His claim to fame has nothing to do with his real music: he played flute on Muslimgauze' 'Mort Aux Vaches' release. But Durand's background is with improvisation and wind instruments. As far as I can remember there is only solo release by him, 'The Art Of Buzzing' on X-TRact/Edition RZ (see Vital Weekly 305), where he plays PVC pipes with saxophone mouthpieces or flower pots and tin foil plates as resonators.\n\nHis great power lies in multi-tracking his playing, obscuring the original sounds through very simple means of layering many on top of each other. After all these years it's still his favorite method of composing music. The cover lists the instruments such as bamboo and metal mouthharps, tanpura, sliding pvc-ney and sliding pvc clarinets with prepared resonators, electronics and delays. The end result is a highly minimalist pattern which he gently waves together, going to small changes all the time, thus avoiding leaping into pure minimal music. One could say that this is drone music, but like before I like to draw a parallel to the work of Phill Niblock, even when Durand's music is a bit more clouded and less detailed. Overall however it's a highly atmospheric set of sounds Durand is playing here. Hopefully more music will be made available and not in another seven years, as this is really nice stuff.\nFrans de Waard - Vital Weekly\n",

On top of all that, the icily femme vocals on the title track and others contrast perfectly with the gritty, brooding backdrop. We also love \"Pressure,\" \"Strange Days\" and \"Wide Dynamics.\"\n",

    "description": "The San Francisco Bay Area's exciting new ensemble, Wildcat Viols, mines the richest vein of the viol da gamba consort repertoire. On this recording you'll hear the astounding music of Henry Purcell and Matthew Locke, the last great masters of English viol music.\n\nIn this, their debut recording, the three women of Wildcat Viols, occasionally joining forces with the delicious soprano voice of Catherine Webster, luxuriate in the daring and passionate sound-world of 17th-century England. By turns quirky, languid, exuberant, sensuous, virtuosic, and always sublime, this music represents the final flowering of England's remarkable viol ensemble repertoire, in which finely-crafted Renaissance equanimity gives way to the dramatic volatility of the Baroque - with a distinctively British accent.\n",

    "description": "On this highly acclaimed album, Dutch pianist Willem Brons plays these beloved piano works of Mozart. The Rondo in A minor with its wealth of intentions and feelings and the Sonata in F major in which Mozart links deep emotions to an inexhaustible fantasy. The Fantasie in C minor provides an impressive introduction to the previously composed Sonata K. 457, as there are numerous connections between both works. For instance, the key, the tragic nature which is so prominent in both works, and the themes. The sonata is majestic and, especially in the first and last movements, distinctly dramatic. Within the first theme, the passionate contrasts already make themselves felt. The emotions are often unusually passionate, but Mozart keeps everything under control in admirable fashion. Exaggeration is not his style, and naturally this also applies to the person interpreting his music.\n\nSome reviews of this album:\n\n\"a cantabile of great beauty\" and \"a monument of serenity and poetical power\"\n- Volkskrant\n\n\"beautiful and with many facets\"\n- Trouw\n\n\"fresh Mozart\"\n- Elsevier\n\n\"there are few records more sincere and honest\"\n- Luister\n\n\"this album is beautiful\"\n- Financieel Dagblad\n\n",

In the Beginning is the culmination of 10 years of experimenting with sounds, song writing structures, and melodies as woodrowgerber performed, recorded, and toured the country with his other musical projects. The drifting melodies and classical compositions take fans on a moody journey touching upon complex emotions while subtly telling a story.\n\nBeing somewhat of an outcast among both old school musicians who regard the digital realm as not being \"real\" music, and digital producers who regard the old school instruments as archaic, woodrowgerber set out to make in the beginning with no rules. The songwriting and production process involved trying whatever techniques he once deemed taboo, and working with them to make music that moves the soul and invokes dreams of the mind. Starting his career out as only a professional guitarist, woodrowgerber has come a long way since his beginning and wanted to highlight his instrument in a tasteful way on the album. Rather than use guitar as the backbone of the compositions as he has done in the past, he decided to cut it out as much as possible in the songwriting process, then return to it and create tasteful fills and licks in moderation in order to blend it more seamlessly with the electronic elements. The result has won over electronic lovers and guitar lovers alike.\n\nHard to define and easy to listen to, In the Beginning is unlike any record you've heard in all the right ways.\n\nalbum written, recorded, produced, and performed by\nChad Gerber\n\nMixing and additional post production by\nGunslunglow and Chad Gerber\n",
