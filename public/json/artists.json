    "description": "A fusion of rock and jazz from the East and the West that brings minds, hearts and souls together",
    "bio": "The music of Abbas Premjee spans many genres, from rock and blues to world and classical.\n\nAbbas has had an undeniable passion for music since an early age. He started playing guitar at 10 and remained largely self-taught until the time he began to formally study music. During his initial years, he played guitar for several rock and jazz bands. It was during this time that he was exposed to classical guitar, which led him to decide to study music formally.\n\nHe completed his Bachelors degree in Music theory and composition from Loyola Marymount University, and then his Masters degree in Classical Guitar from Southern Methodist University, where he studied under Robert Guthrie. A few years later, he returned to Pakistan and opened a recording studio and production house, working with local talent and producing music for TV. As Abbas later realized, coming back to Pakistan was an essential step in his musical growth as it led to his discovery of Indian Classical music. Here he found a world rich in expression. A world unknown to his Western ears. Keen to learn this new language, he took up the Mohan veena, a modern hybrid between a guitar and a sitar, and took instruction in from the legendary sitar player, Ustad Rais Khan.\n\nHaving lived the life of a classical musician on both sides of the fence, and as a rock and jazz musician earlier, Abbas thought of a world where all these expressions could live together. This led to his first CD \"Elements\", on which he collaborated with some of the finest talent in Pakistan. \"Elements\" was released in Pakistan in 2008. It was met with great enthusiasm and very positive reviews in some of the leading newspapers, vastly increasing the scope of music available to the people of Pakistan and introducing them to the subtleties of jazz and classical guitar built on ragas and drones. This was followed by the release of \"Crescent Moon\" in 2011, in which he featured the Mohan veena. Both these albums successfully combined the beauty and grace of the ragas with contemporary sounds and grooves from the rock and jazz genres.\n\nIn 2009, Abbas returned to the United States and has since taken up residence in Irvine, CA where he is active as a composer for media, a teacher, as well as a performer on the mohan veena.",

Although originally being more interested in computer programming than music, this dabbling with music would later go from being a mere hobby to becoming a passion for all things musical.\n\nAlthough Adam's earlier tracks were geared more towards industrial and VGM styles while taking an interest in metal and post-hardcore music, his style would later evolve to encompass a wide variety of sub-genres including dance, ambient, synthpop, downtempo, breaks and neo-classical styles while retaining his unique production style and melodic focus. While studying as a music production student at the University of Huddersfield, Adam began to experiment with incorporating vocals and guitar elements into his music proper, with the former becoming a key element in many of his songs.\n\nAdam has also used his writing and production skills in other projects, including sound design and freelance composition projects for various companies as well as having his music licensed by various firms and individuals. Adam has also worked on various collaborations and remixes with other like-minded musicians.\n\nVisit Adam Fielding on the web at www.adamfielding.com.",

I'm quite happy to have it complete.\n\nThe music is intentionally quite different from my solo contemporary piano work (please note, I do plan to release more solo work).

The group's adventurous programs combine 18th-century music with new works, composed for the group through collaborations and commissions from American composers. An ensemble of eclectic, accomplished, and artful musicians, the performances bridge a gap between the edges of the new music frontier and the familiar roads to music of the past, and expands the repertoire and scope of historical instruments into the new millenium.\n\nIn its early stages, American Baroque functioned as a studio band, its mission being to record hitherto unknown quartets by Telemann. Recordings of the \"Paris\" quartets and the Fourth Book of Quartets were released and enthusiastically received. In 1991, the group recorded French Cantatas of the 18th Century with soprano Julianne Baird, again released to wide critical acclaim on Koch International Classics. In 1992, American Baroque began exploring the territory of performing new music written for historical instruments through its collaboration with composer, member and gambist Roy Whelden and his pieces Quartet After Abel and Gamba Quartet, which resulted in a CD release on the New Albion label in 1993.\n\nIntrigued by the unique timbres and subtlety of sounds inherent in their period instruments as well as the excitement and anticipation of performing new music, the group continued to pursue projects and programming that involved combinations of new and old elements. Another collaboration in 1995 with Whelden yielded the provocative CD Like a Passing River with poet and reader Rudy Rucker, also on the New Albion label.\n\nSince its founding, the ensemble has been featured at the Tage Alter Musik Festival in Regensburg, Germany; the Berkeley Early Music Festival; the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival; the San Jose Chamber Music Society; University of California; the San Francisco Early Music Society; on National Public Radio and West Coast Live; and in the Opus415 New Music Festival. In addition, ensemble members perform and record together in the finest period-instrument orchestras in America throughout the year. Recent projects include concerts at the University of Vermont and at Bowdoin College, and a multi-tracked studio recording of Songs of Cold Mountain, a cycle of texts by the 7th-century poet Han Shan. The 1998-1999 season included a commercial recording of eight pieces by the composer's collective, Common Sense, which were commissioned in 1996; and a theatrical and multimedia collaboration entitled \"The Death of Anton Webern,\" written and directed by ensemble member Katherine Shao; the group will present a 2-week run of performances in May 2000.\n\nAmerican Baroque has also received support from Chamber Music America's Millenium Commissioning Program to collaborate with Stanford University composer Jonathan Berger on his new work, Of Hammered Gold (for flute, oboe, violin, viola da gamba and digital bird organ); the work was premiered at Stanford University's Lively Arts series on January 7, 2000. The ensemble has been recognized through grants and awards from the Aaron Copland Foundation, the Mikhashoff Foundation for New Music, and the Zellerbach Family Fund, and most recently won first prize for the 2000 ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming. American Baroque remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new.",

    "bio": "Amoeba is the result of a multi-decade collaboration between ambient composer Robert Rich and multi-instrumentalist Rick Davies. The two first met in 1979 after Davies returned from a stretch in England and Spain, and throughout the '80s the two would collaborate on several bands, including Quote Unquote and Urdu. To the union Davies brought a wealth of musical experience, and the ability to play winds, guitars, synth and percussion. He also brought an understanding of electronic music which had been deepened during his time editing magazines Music Technology and Home & Studio Recording.\n\nExperimental musician Robert Rich was one of the first people to work with micro-toned synthesizers, and had performed legendary \"sleep concerts\"-eight hour long concerts of ambient music designed to be listened to by a sleeping audience. He also released several solo albums like Trances/Drones which came out in 1983 and Rainforest, which was issued in 1989. He has worked with Steve Roach, David Tom, Lustmord, Lisa Moskow, Vidna Obmana and Forrest Fang. Indeed, his musical aspirations reached all of the way back into childhood, when he was fascinated by the rhythms and textures of sounds in the world around him (croaking frogs, ventilator shafts, etc.). He built his first synthesizer from a kit at the age of 13.\n\nThe second album produced by Amoeba, Watchful is a masterpiece of collective work by Davies and Rich. Featuring a combination of multi-layered ambient textures and pop instrumentation, the album resembles many works that also existed on the edge of pop, like those by Talk Talk and Dead Can Dance. Receiving many positive reviews, Watchful proved that the artistic marriage of Davies and Rich was fruitful, indeed. Pivot followed in late-2000.",

I like to call it \"A GLOBAL SOUND\" that can relate to different genre's and generations.\"\n\nYou can find out more about Anton on his website.",

    "name": "Antonio Ciacca Quartet",
    "description": "Jazz played with earthiness, fire and intellect",
    "bio": "Born in Germany, raised in Italy and educated in the United States, Antonio Ciacca is able to move as fluidly among those varied cultural environments as he does between his life as a performer, composer, father of five, and top-tier arts presenter. Notably, Ciacca has served as artistic director for the Italian cultural agency, C-Jam, and in 2007, landed a plum job as the Director of Programming for Jazz at Lincoln Center, the impetus for his move that year from Bologna, Italy to New York City.\n\nCiacca began his career as a sideman for such acclaimed jazz artists as Art Farmer, James Moody, Lee Konitz, Jonny Griffin, Mark Murphy, Dave Liebman, and Steve Grossman, who he cites as his mentor, and with whom he studied for three years beginning in 1990. In 1993, he moved to Detroit to study at Wayne State University with Kenny Barron, after which he studied privately with Mingus' pianist Jackie Byard in New York. While living in Detroit, he was first exposed to gospel music, which so impressed him with its passion and energy that he soon integrated it into his own developing style as a composer and performer; he eventually went on to produce a CD for the Detroit Gospel Singers.\n\nOne of the most important events in Ciacca's career was an invitation to join the legendary saxophonist Steve Lacy's quartet in 1997; he continued to perform with Lacy for seven years. Another key encounter that would have long lasting musical and professional repercussions for Ciacca took place in 1997. \"Wynton Marsalis was performing in Italy with Elvin Jones, who is my son's godfather. I'd first seen him at the Bologna Jazz Festival in 1989, and he really first opened my eyes to jazz then. But when I first saw him, I had no idea we'd ever work together.\" Ciacca first performed with Wynton in Wess Anderson sextet at New York's Village Vanguard in 2004.\n\nIn 1998 he also began to perform with saxophonist Benny Golson, with whom he continues to collaborate. In 1995, Ciacca recorded his first CD as a leader, Driemoty, which was released on the label C-Jam. In 1999 he recorded in New York City Hollis Avenue for the German label YVP. In 2002, he recorded Autumn in New York for the Italian label Splash.\n\nAfter returning to Italy, Ciacca performed throughout Europe, including an intense series of performances in London in 2003, which included appearances at Ronnie Scott's, the Royal Festival Hall Foyer, the National Theatre and the London Jazz Festival, with \"The Monk Liberation Front\" project, a six hour-long performance that involved thirteen musicians alternately playing Monk's unedited music; The Guardian called out Ciacca's performance as \"terrific.\" After opening for Wynton Marsalis' concerts in Italy, in 2004 Ciacca returned to New York to again perform at the Village Vanguard with his own quartet, featuring renowned saxophonist Wes Anderson, subsequently touring with them throughout the US, UK, and Italy until 2005.\n\nIn Italy in 2004, Ciacca recorded a trio project, Ugly Beauty with the late Dennis Irwin and Detroit mate Ali Jackson for the legendary Italian label Soul Note which he supported with a European tour.\n\nIn 2007, Ciacca's extensive music industry experience and comprehensive artistic vision led to his being tapped to take on the position of Director of Programming at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he works closely with JALC Artistic Director Wynton Marsalis.\n\nThat same year, he met Jana Herzen, founder of Motema Music, at a performance at the Historic Langston Hughes House in Harlem, an intimate brownstone parlor performance space that is sponsored in part by the label. Herzen offered use of the Fazioli piano at the Hughes House to Ciacca for his rehearsal needs, and over the next few weeks she took so well to Ciacca's playing and compositions that the current recording deal was initiated.\n\nIn 2009 Ciacca turned 40. His year long celebrations included: appearance at New York Blue Note, one week engagement at Dizzy's, performances at the Rochester and Detroit International Jazz Festivals, European Tour with George Garzone and Joe Locke special guests, release of his first Music Book, \"the Music of Antonio Ciacca \"Vol. 1\", an invitation to teach \"Business of Jazz\" at Julliard. The participation at the Detroit International Jazz Festival has been for him the climax of a fantastic journey started in Detroit in 1993 when Antonio first touched the USA soil.\n\n2010 marks the release of the second album with Motema Lagos Blues, in two months this album became a rare gift to the jazz world, documenting for the first time the pure joy of be-bop, gospel, and blues influenced pianist/composer Antonio Ciacca's powerful long-term musical relationship with sax legend Steve Grossman. Grossman who rose to fame in the 1970s through incendiary and groundbreaking sessions with Miles Davis, joins Ciacca's deft ensemble (Stacy Dillard, Kengo Nakamura & Ulisses Owens) to swing with impeccable style on this historic disc.\n\nNowadays the New York based pianist and composer Ciacca enjoys his work as Director of Programming at Jazz at Lincoln Center, his family of wife and 5 kids and his beloved jazz piano playing the city jazz clubs.",

Over the thump and shimmer, she croons with detached fervor, the production dissolving in a storm of pixie-dust disco until a rude riot of effects snaps the tether and she vanishes.\n\nAesthetically, the band is a poppier variant on trip-hop, with layers of beats and synth effects providing atmospherics for sophisticated classic rock song structures and the velvet swoop of Artemis's vocals.\n\nArtemis co-produces and performs with various members of the RTFM collective, which includes the polymathic likes of Daniel Berkman (aka Colfax, multi-instrumentalist and wizard of the kora, a twelve-string harp-lute used extensively in West African music), Cliff Tune (the drummer, who adds to orthodox skin-pounding masses of programmed beats layered for pallidly funky effect), Keith Crusher (producer, programmer and sonic theoretician) and newcomer Daniel Durrett, who doles out mind-bending effects with ease, lowering the ambient temperature to dry-ice.\n\nDespite the variety of syncretic means, the whole wraps around the singer in true rockist fashion like a flash-frozen Big Brother and the Holding Company. The music pulses with downtempo beats while ambient sound FX sinks tethers from the world outside into the listener only to pull them pleasantly loose with the band's coruscating riffs and hooky churn.

His uncanny ear for melody, hooks, and arrangement is paralleled only by his captivating voice which seems to carry the weight of a thousand break-ups, but somehow manages to soar effortlessly to a place where joy, goose bumps, and repeated listens are unavoidable. Built on beefy rhythms, unforgettable riffs and clever lyrics that can quickly go from touching to venomous, Arthur's songs are models of contemporary pop song craft.\n\nAfter stints in the Houston based bands, The Jeepneys and Lavendula, Arthur decided to set out on his own and released a self-titled EP in 2001 to much critical acclaim as well as some interest from various major labels. With a solid backing band and a commitment to play live as often as possible, the end of the year brought with it a nomination in the Houston Press Music Awards \"Best New Act\" category and a management deal with Los Angeles based Kio Novina Management (Tenacious D, Sugarcult, Actual Tigers).\n\nFollowing the release of another critically acclaimed EP, can you still look adorable in 2002, Arthur and good friend, former Houston Rocket, Matt Maloney began talking about forming a record label for the purposes of releasing a full-length CD. Two years, a few SXSW showcases, maybe the most nominations for a single artist in the Houston Press Music Awards (for the past three years) and several drunken conversations about the state of the music industry later, Matt and Arthur have finally made good on their plans.\n\nI'll Be Here Awake is Arthur Yoria's debut full-length, self-released album. A stunning achievement, this album shows the Houston based, Chicago native at the apex of his talents. From beginning to end, this 37 and-a-half minute concept pop/rock masterpiece delivers one swift kick after another while leaving imprints, not soon erased of it's well-crafted melodies, undeniable hooks and raw emotions. One of those rare releases that not only wins over the reluctant music snob, but gets the reluctant music snob's grandmother humming; I'll Be Here Awake is that CD that becomes more reliable than your best friend.\n\n\"I just wanted to make a very simple and to the point, rock record about this very nasty and egotistical fictional character that I vicariously live through from time to time,\" Arthur says, \"I went easy on the overdubs after the basic tracks were on tape in order to avoid making the big and lush, singer-songwriter-type record that I was supposed to make and unlike a lot of past studio experiences, I ended up having the time of my life in there. I just hope that the playful atmosphere as well as the contrast between that atmosphere and the sometimes not-so-pleasant subject matter comes through when people listen to this thing.\"\n\nIan Varley plays in Arthur Yoria's live band and is the organist in Drop Trio, a groove-oriented organ-based funk jazz trio.",

They'll grow and change with their songs and the music they play, and so will their music grow and change with them as they move through life. This kind of dedication, over time, can yield some powerful music and goes a long way in creating the kind of creative environment in which the song and the artist become inseparable; where the listener knows, somewhere down deep, that this symmetry of song and singer is the real deal, forged in the fires of life.\n\nAsh Ganley is that type of artist. Ash has been a humble apprentice to many a musical muse over the years, and spent his time touring and recording in bands - as both a bandleader and side man - that have ranged in style from Reggae to Bluegrass, Alt Country to Blues Fusion and Rock and beyond. All of these different styles naturally found a hybrid home in Ash's own unique voice as a singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nIn an age where too often the desire for instant gratification and disposable commercialism have wed to dominate the music marketplace, rare is an artist like Ash Ganley who is able to distil down his myriad musical experiences into such a potent, well-honed mix of roots rock, timeless acoustic pop, and edgy Americana Soul music in a way that sounds seamless, comfortably familiar and totally signature.\n\nAn Ash Ganley Show literally covers all the bases, from an intimate acoustic duo; to the rootsy acoustic slide guitar with stripped down, Delta-inspired drums and bass; all the way up to the high energy full band Americana/Rock/Soul sounds. From Red Rocks to back yard parties, Ash has learned the art of audience-performer energy transference and taps into that natural communion effortlessly.\n\nAsh has a clearly authentic quality to his commercial sound.\n\n\"These Ash Ganley tunes are really good listening and it occurs to one right away that a principle reason is the background vocals of Andria Ganley, which are spot on perfect! She sounds, to me at least, like one of my favorite singers, Margo Timmons. The quality she brings to the sound of this band really elevates it to a higher level.

Following graduation from Middlebury College, Eric spent several years immersing himself in the European musical archives of the Hague, Basel and Marburg. During this time he also did post-graduate studies in composition and musicology at the Frankfurt Conservatory of Music and studied medieval lute with Crawford Young and voice with Richard Levitt at the Schola. He now makes his home in New York, where he has studied with Drew Minter and Gary Ramsey.\n\nSylvia Rhyne brings to the partnership not only her quicksilver soprano but also a strong dramatic connection with the audience, gained from a professional career in musical theater. She has starred internationally as Christine in The Phantom of the Opera and on Broadway as Joanna in Sweeny Todd under the direction of Stephen Sondheim, Harold Prince, and Susan Schulman.\n\nRaised in London and the Pacific Northwest, Sylvia grew up surrounded by classical music, opera and dance. She pursued a passion for early music at Carleton College, guided by Stephen Kelly, taking leading roles in early operas and operettas on her way to a degree in music. She studied also with Wesley Balk at St. Olaf College and recorded with Dennis Russell Davies and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. Arriving in New York, Sylvia was invited to sing with the New York City Opera and began ongoing coaching with Marcy Lindheimer.\n\nEric and Sylvia first connected through singing with John Hetland's Renaissance Street Singers, a group that brings a cappella 15th and 16th century music to New York City sidewalks and parks. The pair immediately discovered their mutual interest in earlier repertoire and began meeting regularly to work on late medieval pieces, gradually developing their passionate approach to the music. Asteria's performances convey the anguish and ecstasy of the poetry and the rapturous beauty of the interweaving vocal and instrumental lines.\n\nThe result of Asteria's exploration can be heard on their first recording of 15th century chansons, Le Souvenir de Vous me Tue.",

    "bio": "Grown up in East Germany (GDR), Steve Crock initially came into touch with music through American radio stations and RIAS at an early age. He listened to the music and taped it up on audio cassettes. Soon after he cut his teeth in DJ'ing (House, Acid, Funk). After the fall of the Berlin Wall he went to his first club-music party in Munich.\n\nHe visited the Love Parade and gradually came in contact with Berlin's underground club scene. Later on he interested himself in Goa and Psytrance, appeared as a DJ in that scene and was desirous to produce his own music of that style. So he got the essential equipment and \"learning by doing\"; produced his own tracks. Crock graduated as a sound engineer (SAE Berlin). On the Internet Steve Crock made contact with Ben Barks in 2007.\n\nUnlike Crock, Ben Barks was born and raised in Western Germany and gained an early musical education by his father's rock 'n' roll records as well as by the British Forces Radio's 80's music. As a teenager he learned to play the guitar and fell in love with blues music. As a prisoner of his Western German wasteland circumstances, Ben was primarily influenced by Metal, Punk and Britpop (Oasis, Blur) before he focused on 'the classics' (Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors).\n\nHe acquired his first expieriences as the leader of a band which was oriented towards Hardrock (Hellacopter, Motörhead etc), but for Barks pure guitar music always seemed to be too single-edged, until some day he booted the computer and added electronic drums and keyboards. For a long time he absented himself from rock 'n' roll and the stage and along the way exclusively produced electronic music. He moved to Berlin and was fascinated by the electronic music scene. As mentioned before he met Steve Crock on the Internet and since then they've been working together as producers.\n\nThey started their collaboration as 'Long Trigger', an electro-and-guitar-band with a female voice. Long Trigger appeared live in clubs and festivals until the female singer left the band. After that 'Long Trigger' was born, with Ben Barks as leader plus an additional guitarist. Long Trigger played a mixture of electronic music with strong guitar riffs. At that time the artist duo did a quick side-trip and produced tracks and remixes for a soundtrack (Angel's Call). But since 2010, Barks and Crock have exclusively been focused on producing and occasional collaborations with featured artists of Berlin's electronic music scene.",

Picking up the trombone in junior high gave him a taste for the style and flexibility of jazz music, which he utilized through high school in various jazz performing groups, orchestras, and pit bands for school plays. Then while browsing a rummage sale table he stumbled onto a beat up old acoustic guitar. Soon he was practicing for hours at a time to find the limits and textures of this new instrument.\n\nBarry has been collaborating with other musicians since 1995, and is a veteran of many groups, including the dream pop band, The Sunflower Conspiracy, and the Tucson based alternative rock band Affirming the Consequent. In addition, he has written film score and songs for various projects, including the short film, The Human Condition, which debuted at independent film festivals in April 2008, and the infectious theme to and overall musical signature of the ironic and entertaining webisode comedy, Crewing Up.\n\nBarry James uses guitars, effects, and computer recording techniques to create a sound that is as orchestral as it is modern. His work often brings comparisons to Brian Eno, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel and Enya.\n\nIf anyone is poised to inject new life into the ambient sound it is Barry James. His work in music is genre-spanning and continues to evolve as he seeks out new projects and creates new challenges for himself. James is heavily involved in exploring the push and pull between music and images.\n\nYou can learn more about Barry on his website.",

From his recordings of American Shaker melodies to an album of Rumi's poetry set to strings, Phillips' expansive body of work has been gleaned from traditions around the globe and encompasses more than eight centuries of music.\n\nPhillips' newest album Trad. is a contemporary celebration of Scandinavian folk songs and original compositions. In addition to Phillips on cello, Trad. features two of Sweden's premier players: master nyckelharpist Olov Johansson of the band Vasen and virtuoso fiddler, Olof Gothlin. The album's title combines the abbreviation for the English word \"traditional\" and the Swedish and Norwegian word \"trad,\" meaning \"thread.\" It's an album rich with the character of Scandinavian folklore, while its modern, streamlined arrangements make for a sound both elegant and earthy.\n\nPhillips holds a Masters of Music degree in composition from the San Francisco Conservatory and has collaborated with Ravi Shankar on several compositions, including two pieces for celebrated cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. In November of 2002, he accompanied Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, and other rock luminaries in The Concert for George-a memorial to George Harrison at The Royal Albert Hall in London. He has performed and recorded with such world renowned artists as fiddler Alasdair Fraser, harpist Aine Minogue, and the legendary British rock group Camel.\n\nPhillips' previous recordings include Gourd's Shaker Trilogy (co-produced with William Coulter): Simple Gifts, Tree of Life, and Music on the Mountain.

I was immediately hooked on the raw, funky style and investigated further.\n\nLearning these songs by ear was difficult as many are tuned differently from traditional guitar tunings and many artists of that era used capos to change keys which made it almost impossible to figure out what the tunings were. Eventually I stumbled across a video of Bukka White playing what looked like open E tuning. I tried it and voila! I was playing Robert Johnson licks in no time.\n\nI recorded my first 4 cd's in a little less than 12 months, 3 more followed in quick succsession.\n\nAfter years of playing complicated and almost orchestrated music that took days or weeks to record one song, it was refreshing to be able to knock out several songs in a day with just a guitar and a microphone. The fingerstyle picking allows the guitarist to use the thumb for the bass notes the the first and second fingers for the melody and chords. A full band can be imitated with just one guitar in this manner. This is one of the defining techniques of country blues (also know as delta blues). I've also taken up the blues harp which is featured in many of my songs as a solo or melodic intrument.\n\nI'm also recording what I call 'full band' blues at home on my trusty Apple Mac which includes electric guitar, bass, drums, and even some electronica influences. Many of these songs reference the minimal sounds of the Chess Records recordings of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter. So far I have recorded two CD's of 'electric blues'. I hope you enjoy my music - many people believe the blues is a dyiing art from ut nothing coudl be further from the truth, if anything it's growing and web sites like Magnatune can do nothing but help further 'the cause'.",

She turned 18, packed her Jeep (leaving enough room for her New York attitude, of course), and headed for Hollywood...and we all know what happens in Hollywood.\n\nFueled by an intrinsic need to express, to create, and to rock faces, BREAKER is the musical creation of lead singer, Liz Granite. Shortly after arriving in the City of Angels, Granite began cutting demos and developing what would soon be the BREAKER sound. Her voice, chock full o' grit and unbridled emotion, captured the attention of record producer, Dean Dichoso. Granite wrote and recorded the band's debut record, \"The More I Want, The More I Get\" with the support of Dichoso, who also played bass and guitar on the 10-track album. It wasn't until the completion of the album that Granite assembled a live band who could truly bring BREAKER to life.\n\nWhen Will Walz agreed to engineer Granite's vocals alongside Dichoso, he didn't realize he'd be getting a band out of the deal. Granite and Walz became fast friends, and when it came time to find band mates, Walz was a shoo-in to be BREAKER's bassist. The pair teamed up with drummer, G Herrera, who had caught Granite's eye tearing up the LA music scene with a couple other hot bands. The trio rounded out their five-piece line-up with two guitarists who were brought to them by the miracle of Craigslist. The band played their first show together in April of 2009, just two months before the release of their first album, and haven't stopped since.\n\nCombining contrasting worlds of bombast and bliss, BREAKER's music is as seductive as it is damn-near fatal. The five-piece proudly serves up a juicy slab of female-fronted guitar-driven rock with a sweet dose of off-kilter mood and a little heartfelt angst (for good measure). In-your-face vocals paired with provocative lyrics cap off the band's inimitable sound.\n\nTen powerful songs from their debit album demonstrate the depth and diversity of Breaker's talent while maintaining a straightforward and unapologetic attitude throughout.\n\nCBS's Rockstar: Supernova winner, Lukas Rossi, offers his distinct vocals to the rock duet, \"Tenfold True\", and Candiria drummer, Ken Schalk, keeps the beat boisterous and untamed throughout this refreshingly raucous record.\n\nBREAKER is breathing new life into music's staling rock scene. By pouring their busted hearts n' souls into each and every song and performance, BREAKER stands apart from the crowd, offering fans straight-up, unfiltered rock packaged in well-crafted and catchy songs. Their live shows, which are akin to New Year's Eve, a rowdy bachelor party, and a high school kegger all rolled into one, have been winning over fans throughout southern California.",

    "description": "13th century medieval English songs",
    "bio": "The name Briddes Roune (BREE-dess RONE) is Middle English for bird song/conversation/speech and is a reference to the fact that two of the three of us are named Robin. I formed Briddes Roune specifically to record early medieval English songs, a repertoire I have been singing for several years. As anyone who's read Chaucer aloud knows, Middle English has a delightfully musical lilt, making it a fun language to sing, and the English fondness for thirds and sixths gives the music a sweetness that is unusual for that time.\n\nThis recording includes the songs of St. Godric, who claimed that all of his songs came to him in visions. For example, during a vision in which he saw Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary, the Virgin taught him \"Sainte Marie viergene,\" saying that if he found himself in pain or tired or succumbing to temptation, he should sing this song and she would come quickly to his aid. Godric died in 1170, making these songs the earliest songs in English with extant melodies. More on St. Godric can be found in the liner notes.\n\nI am particularly drawn to the songs without fixed rhythms. The rhythms of songs such as \"Stond wel, moder, under roode\" and \"Ar ne kuth, ich sorghe non\" are driven by the speaking rhythms of the words and by musical intuition. I like the improvised quality of these songs, and I enjoy the extra opportunity to express the text.\n\nPerforming medieval music involves some challenges not faced by those interested in later music. Instrumental accompaniments were almost never written down, and even the choice of instruments used was quite free. What you hear on this recording is very much our own arrangement. Our instrumental parts arise from a combination of planning and improvisation. Instrumental countermelodies are generally written out in advance by either Kathryn or myself. Drone parts are generally worked out in rehearsal. The process goes something like this:\n\nKathryn: How about this?\nRobin S.: ...mmm...no...maybe an A? ...no...a D? ...no....\nKathryn: What about this?\nRobin S: Yeah, that's best.\nKathryn: That's what I played originally.\n\nAll instrumental preludes and interludes are improvised.\n\nIn addition to the challenge of writing our own instrumental parts, very few English songs have survived with their melodies, although we have many lyrics. For the surviving melodies, I have used E.J. Dobson and F. Ll. Harrison's book, Medieval English Songs. For others (e.g. Lenten is come, Lutel wot hit any mon), I have set lyrics in the style of that time and place. I typically start by choosing a mode, which defines what notes are in the scale and which are most important, and then I start playing with the words, improvising tunes. When I get a fragment that I like, I write it down, and gradually the piece begins to take shape.",

    "bio": "Interview with Tim Mcdonald of the Broken Poets\nFrom Earthvillage.com, interview By Gary Ponzo\nSunday, July 20, 2008\nUsed by permission\n\nTim sat down with me recently to discuss his career and the revelation that we are responsible for the maintenance of nature and ourselves. Something which he believes so strongly that fifty percent of the new CD's proceeds will be donated to The Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace and Oxfam. I started by asking him why he wrote songs:\n\nTim McDonald: Well (Laughing) I probably started as a teenager just needing to work through any stress that I had and didn't know how to express it any other way, but now it's sort of evolved into something else. It's more of a craft and I'm able to do it and think at the same time (Laughs).\n\nEarth Village: The band began in New York and made a pit stop in New Orleans and Austin before settling back down in your hometown of Phoenix.What was your New York experience like?\n\nTM: New York was great. I got to work with some unbelievably talented people, Robert Scoville (Tom Petty's sound engineer) and Jonathan Mover (Drummer with Fuel and Alice Cooper), plus Keith Lentin who is one of the top session players in New York. Also, I got to play in the same clubs that Dylan played in and record at Skyline Studios where bands like Fleetwood Mac and David Bowie recorded. As a matter of fact Steely Dan came in right after we did our demo, so I guess you could say we got to open up for them at the studio (Laughs).\n\nEV: You were there on September 11th?\n\nTM: Yeah, I love New York. I was deciding between LA and New York and chose New York because of the people. I mean, if you're going to be rejected they'll tell you right to your face instead of behind your back and that's just so refreshing.\n\nBut yeah, September 11th, it was horrible for the entire country, but in the city itself, it was just . . I mean six months later they were still having funerals and it just seemed like the bottom dropped out. That's when I thought about New Orleans (Laughs) I guess I was just going on tour of all the disaster sites.\n\nEV: Then Austin?\n\nTM: Yeah, I liked the music scene there, but it just seemed too small after New York. That's when I came back to Phoenix and the funny thing is, I grew up here my whole life hearing the words Paradise Valley and I never really got it, I didn't even think about what those two words meant, I just took it for granted I guess and after two years in New York I came back and I'm like, \"Paradise Valley,\" I get it now, it's freaking paradise.\n\nEV: So now you're back in Arizona and have your own record label, Wordvendor, how has the digital age affected your career?\n\nTM: I tell you honestly, the greatest thing that ever happened to me was never really getting signed by a major record label. I mean I had one record deal with a company that really didn't have any money, so we got shelved and stuck in a corner. I'm so glad to be out of that. Now with Wordvendor, I'm in full control and I've got a catalog of music that I can license. The worst thing a band could do right now is sign with a record label, because they still haven't figured out how to deal with the whole digital sales side of things.\n\nEV: \"Optimism in E-Minor,\" was such a great collection of songs\n\nTM: Thank you.\n\nEV: How do you follow up something that you had so much success with, or do you always feel that your newest CD is like your new baby?\n\nTM: Yeah, I really do think that the new record is better, I feel like we tried to write pop songs on \"Optimism in E Minor\" and the new one is just a little more heartfelt.\n\nEV: As with all emerging artists you sometimes need to find other ways to pay the mortgage. Tell me about the time you decided you weren't going to do anything but take your guitar and live by whatever you made on your music alone.What was that like?\n\nTM: Wow. Yeah, well, I decided to go play coffee houses throughout Arizona and into California and back, and just tour and tour and it's kind of funny because even though people seemed to like the music and they bought my CD's, I felt that the audience would look at me like . . . how good could I really be if I was playing in a coffee house . . . I mean you're only going to be taken so seriously when you're in that kind of venue, no matter how talented you are. I felt that people were listening to my songs thinking that they were songs that were being played on the radio, but they just didn't know who sung them. So I decided I needed to go back to just writing songs and picking my spots. And with the band I've been lucky enough to fall into some decent opening gigs over the last few years with Seven Mary Three, James McMurtry and Ian Moore.At this point it's a matter of quality over quantity.\n\nEV: But could you survive on your music alone if need be?\n\nTM: Oh, absolutely. I mean I'd barely get by, but I could make it work. I'll always find a way to make it work.\n\nEV: Now, tell me about the title of the new CD, \"Everything in Nature,\" and how you got so involved with environmental issues.\n\nTM: Okay so I'm outside thinking about my career and questioning all these decisions, what I should be doing, and just thinking about myself so much and I'm staring at the trees and the nature around me, and thinking--I mean I'm a songwriter so I think too much already anyway--and I'm going over thoughts in my head and I started to realize that everything around me in nature wasn't asking these questions. And that was the first thought that came to me--how interesting, maybe I could write a song about it, but it just hit me that everything in nature has its own pre-determined will already set within it. I mean we might think we have free will to do what we want, but in a way our body becomes a fully grown body on its own will, I mean you're not telling your body to become a fully grown woman or man, so there are things, even within ourselves, that are already set in place, but we're the only thing in nature that is aware of itself, and therefore it must be our responsibility to help maintain it. So it was that initial realization that sparked the inspiration for the songs, and once the record was done I thought -- Let's give back instead of worrying about ourselves so much. It just seemed the obvious thing to do considering where the songs came from.\n\nEV: For an artist like yourself who's not wealthy or financially set, it's a pretty bold move to donate so much money (50% of all the proceeds) to these causes, so it's obviously something you must feel strongly about.\n\nTM: Yeah, it really had an impact on me and made me realize how selfish I'm being and we're all being, I mean the songs on the record really speak to that. We're all here trying to make our mark on the world to the detriment of the planet.In fact we're releasing this video now for the song \"Idle Thought\" and you want to know what the great thing about the video is?\n\nEV: What?\n\nTM: We're not in it. (Laughs) ... I mean I'm not knocking other bands, but we're all stuck in this mentality of, \"What new guitar can I hold in the video while I'm strumming my chords and acting like I'm singing my song. What look can I give? \" It's just so ridiculous. When I came up with the idea of not being in the video I started watching other videos and thought we're just repeating ourselves over and over--you know, \"How cool can I look? How can I be a rock star?\" and I never wanted to be a rock star, it's never been about that. Maybe when I was really young that might've been exciting, but I've never really wanted that. Just think how many times an artist's video will get in the way of perceiving a song? When you're in your car listening to a song on the radio, the songwriter's words become images in your mind, and it becomes your song.\n\nEV: You create your own video to the music.\n\nTM: Exactly. But then you watch the video on TV and you're stuck with Billy Idol in your face. (Laughs) Everyone seems to be busy playing rock star so it's all about them and not the song, I mean I realize we have to have some kind of image and I understand that, but if I'm going to be about anything it's going to be about the songs, not about, \"How cool can I look.\" I know I'm guilty of doing the same thing, and it works for a lot of bands, I just think an artists can get in the way of their own song, and in this case I would have.\n\nEV: Do you think of yourself as a storyteller or someone who molds images in someone's mind?\n\nTM: Yeah, the songs seem to come in different spurts like that. One minute I'm telling a story and the next I'm throwing out images, it's hard to put a finger on what I do. I guess I put words together that create images and usually a story unfolds from there. But it's never contrived.\n\nEV: If you knew definitively that there were no listeners left on the planet and it was just you . . . no one else.Would you still be writing songs?\n\nTM: Wow, that's a great question. Well, okay, here's the dilemma. I've always heard these musicians say, \"I don't give a crap what people think about my music,\" and the first thing I think is, \"If you didn't care what people thought then go out in the desert and play. Why are you bothering to play where anybody could hear you.\" And so of course there's always that side of me that wants to be heard. But I have to be honest there is this other side of me that just enjoys sitting by myself and writing songs. Maybe just playing for the cat, although I guess you could consider that an audience.\n\nBut, yeah, an artist always wants some reflection from an audience, everybody does, if they say they don't then I think they're lying. So I guess to answer your question, yes I would still play, but it would be discouraging to know that it would never be heard.\n\nEV: Early in your career, like many young artists, you drank and smoked to excess at times. Then around 21 or so you just quit everything. What effect did that have on your songwriting? And your life, for that matter.\n\nTM: Yeah, I guess I was heading down a path that wasn't going anywhere and I was kind of hiding from my feelings, but as soon as I stopped drinking I'll tell you what, everything just opened up and I was able to access a part of my creativity that I was never able to access before and that just keeps growing and getting richer and richer and it all started when I quit. I'm just so grateful to be able to look back and see where I came from. It gives me some perspective.\n\nEV: So what's the future look like?\n\nTM: Well, I'm already writing songs for the next record, but that's probably a couple of years away. I'll be spending most of my time promoting \"Everything in Nature.\" I've got this great publicist who is able to get the record into the right hands for reviewing. Then of course I have Wordvendor, which is the greatest thing now because I can actually steer my career in the direction I want and have total control--I mean do you think a record label would allow me to give 50% of my proceeds to a cause like Greenpeace? Don't get me wrong, a record label knows how to make money, and I guess that's my next challenge. But I couldn't be happier with the path I'm heading down now. It's an exciting time to be an artist.",

But of course Thornside had a boss over him, a crazy but nice man from Iran. When he heard that Thornside sang and played the trumpet, he immediately insisted (or \"decided\" is probably the right word) that Thornside should play for the guests between four and five every Tuesday. Thornside called his old friend Burnshee, with whom he was playing in different bands, and asked him to play with him.

Thornside singing, playing trumpet and banjo, and Thornside playing the guitar. Two hundred Swedish kronor and a free meal was the deal.

One thing is for sure: they did not come only to hear Thornside and Burnshee.)\n\nIt started in the early 80's\nJohan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - Burnshee Thornside - met in their teens and formed many bands playing mostly funk. It was the days of the \"slapping bass\" so you had to get hold of a good bassplayer, who knew how to use his thumb. Compared to the rock bands, you also had to have horns, and you had to know how to arrange for horns. Trumpets, saxophones, trombones. Thornside, being also a trumpet player, knew that, so we had great horn arrangements from day one. We made a lot of our own music, played many gigs, and we listened to Earth Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, Steely Dan, Koinonia, Gino Vanelli, Chaka Khan, Rufus, James Brown, jazz and blues, Zappa, Weather Report... Sometimes Burnshee and Thornside would meet up in the rehearsal studio to record together, on their own. A little pleasure they had, together with the 4-track Fostex Cassette Recorder. It sounded very Motown...\n\nThe year 2003\nAfter pursuing different careers (IT, Advertising, computers), of course neither Thornside or Burnshee made a living out of music, altough it gave some good extra money, Burnshee finally made one of his dreams come true: his own studio in the basement. Based around a Mac G4 and Logic. All of a sudden Burnshee and Thornside were back were it all started. Recording, making music, composing, arranging. They looked at each other and decided to start all over. But first they had to get rid of their Swedish sounding names - Johan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - so they named themselves Burnshee Thornside and their first recording in the new studio was of their old song \"Hey Hey Hey\" (which now appears on the Burnshee Thornside Album Blues and misc.) After that they composed 14 brand new songs and invited the magic musician Tomas Bergquist in to play drums and bass (he is still with us). The releasing of \"The Art Of Not Blending In\" was quite successful, there being no record label behind it. We got some airtime on a small radiostation in Oregon, and Australia, and we sold some albums via magnatune.com who supported us from the start. Everybody said it sounded like Steely Dan and Michael McDonald, mostly thanks to Thornside's voice, we guess, but also due to the fact that the music is kind of Rhythm & Blues. With a jazzy feeling. And then a bit funky. And with horns. The lyrics, that's quite another story. They are not only about love. They can be about anything...\n\nThe years 2004 and 2005\nIn 2004 Burnshee Thornside released \"Blues & misc.\", as the title reveals, a whole lot of blues, but also funky jazzy stuff, 12 tracks. A bit more simple. Not as many horn arrangements. Not as many background vocals performed by great sounding female singers. But still very good. (Some regard \"Blues and misc.\" as better than \"The Art Of Not Blending In\".)\n\nAnd then, in 2005, came \"Rock This Moon\". 15 new tracks, back to more horns, more background vocals, more 70's jazzy/funky Steely Dan-ish. With fun, intriguing and whacky lyrics.\n\nIs this only the beginning? Yes, we think so! And maybe, just maybe, one day people will come to McDonalds only because Burnshee Thornside is playing in the sound system.",

    "bio": "Why not pack up and leave to chase a dream in New York City? You only live once and even then for a relatively short period of time.\n\nIn the beginning there were three men in Lexington, KY. These men were Cedric Sparkman, Laurence Adams and Jason Matuskiewicz.\n\nReally, though, this band started at one discrete moment in time. In Hazard, Perry County, Kentucky, the foothills of Appalachia, when Cedric saw Laurence buy a copy of The Smiths' Hatful of Hollow at the local Wal-mart and thought, \"Hey, that boy who could barely play 'Hey Jude\" might be pretty cool after all.\" So, as young, foolish musical men are so often wont to do, they decided to start a cover band - a mixture of The Smiths and David Bowie covers. Yes, in Hazard, Kentucky. I know, right?\n\nThey carried this back to the teaming metropolis of Lexington, KY, where both were then living. In the meantime, Laurence met Jason, who was then but one modest young man playing acoustic singer-songwriter shows somewhat haphazardly - with little ambition and even less effort. After some time in Morehead, Kentucky, the hardwood capital of the world, and Heidelberg, Germany, Cedric returned to Lexington, and he and Laurence succeeded in putting together a Smiths cover band that didn't actually play Smiths songs, called Varsovia - which is to say it comprised equal parts pastiche and encomium. They invited Jason to join the band, but with the catch that he play bass, an instrument he had never played before. It turned out Jason was a natural. And Varsovia released two EPs, brilliantly titled EP1 and EP2 - before calling it a day in 2009.\n\nIn the interest of making everything as difficult as possible, which, along with arguing like brothers, is a favorite Candidate pastime, after deciding to form a new band, Cedric, Jason and Laurence wrote over 30 new songs before playing a show. After a couple of shows, the band recorded an album, A New Life. Although the songs were all written collaboratively, the album contained a loose narrative roughly following the dissolution of Jason's marriage. They released the album in June 2011. The album was received well, but tragedy befell the band and robbed the band of its momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of his time in the band, Cedric Sparkman succumbed to that emotion that is the inveterate enemy of rock n roll, love. When his girlfriend (who is wonderful by the way) graduated from her MFA program in New York City, she and Cedric decided they would live there. And so he did in August 2011. Jason, deciding there was little to keep them at his lucrative career as a young lawyer, other than money, comfort and the promise of being able to buy food in the future, and Laurence, wishing to test his mettle in the Brooklyn wastes, they would join Cedric - chasing a dream in the big city.\n\nShortly after arriving in New York, Candidate met Chris Infusino, a real live pro drummer, who joined them for their first show in NYC. He killed it. After the show, Jason asked Chris if he would like to join them in recording the band's next album. Chris asked when this recording was to begin, to which Jaosn replied, \"Next week.\" Ah, Candidate, always keeping everything as difficult as possible. Chris cleared his schedule and joined the band.\n\nTeaming up with boy genius and super producer, Justin Craig, the band make their second album. The sound they made could not be placed in any particular subgenre, so they called it dreamrock - a sonically expansive, and forward looking mixture of post-punk and shoegaze with 80's and 90's American indie, grunge and britpop. The album continues and concludes the narrative that started on the first LP, \"A New Life.\" This time, however, the narrative was shaped by Cedric, although the narrator is the same mostly fictional character. The album reflects the personal struggles and ultimate triumph he experienced upon his move to New York.",

Since moving to New York, Carey has been a prominent musician, performing with many RnB, Rock, Gospel, and Jazz groups. Recently expanding his skill set to recording and production, Carey is now involved in a number of recording and producing projects from his home studio.\n\nThe album Oak was recorded entirely in Carey's home studio. This album has lots of layers to it; with many interweaving guitar parts, overlayed vocals, and ambient effects. Initially conceived as a collection for yoga practice or meditation, the music began to evolve in another, sometimes more aggressive direction, as evidenced in the song \"West Texas Sunrise\".\n\n\"This is an autobiographical piece about a cross country trip I was taking with a friend, where along the way, somewhere in the middle of nowhere West Texas, while speeding down the highway I blew two tires and nearly flipped the car over. We spent all night waiting for a tow truck under the beautiful open sky, and ended sleeping that night in the parking lot of a tire store.\" This song in particular and the collection overall is an effort in uniting those horrific moments with those beautifully serene ones.\n\nYou can find out more about Carey on his website.",

    "bio": "Born in Champaign, IL, Ceremony of Darkness is comprised of members unique even among their brethren inhabiting the darker corners of the music scene. With backgrounds in literature, music theory, the military, and even boxing, the members of Ceremony of Darkness are as varied as the tracks on their premiere album \"13\".\n\nSin and J started the band with a predominantly metal focus. Over time they found that some of the slower songs they threw into sets during longer shows were taking hold within certain segments of the fan base. There was enough demand for their more melodic works that they began to get booked regionally for acoustic sets. Eventually, Ceremony of Darkness was able to find its balance and could play its melodic works, basic rock songs, and its heaviest metal tracks together in a way that honestly displayed the band's identity and appealed to all corners of their diverse fan base.\n\nWhen asked about the approach of Ceremony of Darkness, Sin explains, \"Look, I may personally love metal, but even the heaviest fans like to slow it down or lighten it up now and then, just so long as they don't feel like they 'sold out' along the way. It is all about identity and balance. If you lose who you are by not writing in the same exact key or style every time, you are probably not being yourself anyway. Our music is intense for the most part, but it isn't as if we sit around mad or sad all day either. At shows we will party and joke with our fans as much as they will let us. I just don't think you can take yourself too seriously, no one else does.\"\n\nThough they may not take themselves too seriously, they do take their music seriously. Tempo changes, intricate guitars, and varied vocal styles are utilized to create just the right effect for each individual song Ceremony of Darkness writes. Their premiere album \"13\" showcases 13 of the over 100 songs Ceremony of Darkness has worked to perfect. \"13\" forms a unique expression of dark rock appealing to mainstream listeners as well as fans of metal, and those within the darker subcultures of music. Ceremony of Darkness does not fear displaying the varied nature of their influences, as anyone attending a show will clearly see by the diversity of their fan base. Vocalist Sin explains, \"We [the band members] come from different backgrounds and have different musical tastes. Some of us have our roots in metal, while others come from a jazz background or are into mainstream rock. Rather than fight it, we embrace the elements involved and believe that just like an individual has different aspects to their personality, if they are being honest, so will their music. Being one-dimensional as a band would be disingenuous and essentially amount to calling our fans one-dimensional too, and we don't want to do that.\" In fact, \"13\" features songs ranging from slow and melodic (Breathless), to straight forward rock (Freedom), to songs one might consider throwback death metal (The Surgeon of New Orleans).\n\nWhen listening to \"13\" a return to intricate guitar musicianship will be noted as well as vocal styles that change to suit each song rather than making the music conform to the vocals. One dominant theme in the music of Ceremony of Darkness that will become evident to listener however is the dark, emotional, and haunting imagery that brings a mood of intensity to each song. \"I have always been a fan of Poe,\" recalls Sin, \"and what I took from his style is that no piece of your work should detract from your overall purpose. In the case of songwriting, we try to remove anything that is not in some way essential to the song's design. Our music is about emotion, so we describe each emotion in the greatest detail that we are able.\"\n\nThe Band Members -\nSin - vocals and rhythm guitar\nJ - Rhythm and lead guitars\nRyan Basch - Bass\nBrandon Zeisler - Drums\nJason Dix - Drums (alternate)\nBrian Mantia - Guitars\nGeorge Kiser - Additional live guitars (alternate)\nAlex Lopez - Additional live keys\n\nCeremony of Darkness have WON Best Metal/Hardcore Album of 2010, by the Independent Music Awards.\n\nTheir song \"The Surgeon of New Orleans\" has also been nominated in the Metal genre for the Hollywood Music in Media Awards.\n\nFor more on the band please visit their website or MySpace page.",

    "bio": "Chad Farran has made a name in the San Diego music scene by playing hundreds of shows with many local bands throughout the region, producing music for TV shows and independent films, and recording album projects for local musicians.\n\nOver the past 5 years he has been involved in the production of music for the popular surf/travel show On Surfari that airs on FOX network's Fuel TV, and has managed to capture the essence of foreign countries that the show travels to by studying the traditions and instruments from each place, incorporating them into musical pieces, and creating a contemporary and refreshing soundtrack.\n\nFarran's most recent release is On Surfari Sessions, with 22 songs featured in the first season of Fuel TV's On Surfari. The album features a rich landscape of music with ethnic instrumentation and grooves inspired by travels to India, Panama, Mauritius and New York.\n\nIn 2007 Farran released an album from the original compositions he had written as a singer/songwriter. Another Ride uses the same techniques as his soundtrack work to fuse Latin sounds and rhythms with the acoustic pop melodies that were inspired by influential recording artists both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFarran's interest in Brazilian culture makes an impressive influence on Another Ride, as he weaves stories of love found and love lost with the rhythms that enchanted him on his travels throughout that country. The Brazilian styles of Samba, Bossa Nova, Reggae, Forro, and Maracatu can all be heard in his songs, as he showcases his talents on the instruments he collected and brought back.\n\nThe live shows can range from a mellow solo performance to the energy of a full band, but always captivate audiences with diverse instrumentation and lyrical content sung in both English and Portuguese.\n\nChad now begins the task of opening the minds of the music lover and enticing them with the infectious rhythms and melodies he has captured so well on his albums.",

    "bio": "Multi-award winning pianist and composer Chad Lawson has an impressive list of accomplishments in recent years that many artists could only hope for in a lifetime. He has released seven critically acclaimed albums, worked with renowned musicians and producers and has the distinguished honor of being a Steinway artist.\n\nBorn in North Carolina, Chad knew he wanted to be a musician at the age of five. He pursued this dream at age 18 when he enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. While in school, Chad began his career as a studio musician and after his studies at Berklee, he decided to go on tour with Babik Reinhardt (son of legendary jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt).\n\nFollowing his stint on the road, Chad formed the Chad Lawson Trio. They released their self-titled debut album in 1997 followed by Dear Dorothy; The Oz Sessions (jazz trio arrangements of The Wizard of Oz) in 2002 and Unforeseen two years later. Taking a sabbatical from the jazz trio in 2007, Lawson went on tour in Europe and South America with Julio Iglesias as a keyboardist.\n\nIn 2009, Chad released his first solo album, Set on a Hill. The album was produced by the legendary Will Ackerman (Grammy winner/Founder of Windham Hill Records) and was voted \"Album of the Year\" by Whispering Solo Piano's 1 million listeners.\n\n2011 was a year of overachievement for Chad as he generated two albums and one single. The Piano was released in October to rave reviews and also awarded, \"Classical Album of the Year\" by Solopiano.com. In August 2011, Chad offered Song of Prayer, a 32-minute improvisational single. This musical masterpiece provided the perfect soundtrack for introspective reflection and meditation. He ended the year with the full-length, A Solo Piano Christmas, featuring his renditions of classic Christmas songs. Reviews New Age proclaimed, \"Superb! 5 out of 5 stars.\"\n\nThe Space Between, released in 2013, is Chad's latest effort. The album hit #12 on Amazon's Adult Alternative Chart which is an impressive feat for an independent release.

The host, John Diliberto, an award-winning radio producer and music writer, has earned the reputation of only playing groundbreaking music and rarely selects pianist tracks for his program. By adding, \"I Know a Love so Fair and True,\" \"A Love is Born,\" \"Falling Together\" and a cover of Band of Horses' \"No One's Gonna Love You\" to the \"Echoes\" song rotation, this highly influential tastemaker reaffirms the artistic significance of Chad Lawson and his works.\n\nChad's music has been played on NPR, Delta Airlines flights and in Starbucks coffee shops. Television shows (Dawson's Creek, MTV's Teen Mom 2), movies (DoughBoys, Plimpton!) and commercials (Bacardi, Relais Chateaux upscale boutique hotels) have also utilized his works. The Notebook, an upcoming Broadway musical where Chad was brought on to arrange and notate the show's musical pieces.\n\nWhile working as a keyboardist with an artist on Sony Records, the late and legendary music producer Phil Ramone told celebrated music director Jack Douglas, \"You have an amazing keyboard player.\" It was an unforgettable compliment that Chad still cherishes to this day.\n\nChad Lawson is a master musician and artist extraordinaire.

    "bio": "The Chambure Vihuela Quartet is a group of American musicians who formed around the joy of playing Spanish Renaissance music. They are the only group to play Spanish polyphony on a set of matched instruments modeled on one of the few surviving original instruments, the \"Chambure\" Vihuela, now in the Cite de la musique in Paris, France.\n\nThe Vihuela Society of Spain says of the recording: \"...excellent work of arrangement and interpretation ... resulting in something completely new.\"\n\nEdward Martin (soprano vihuela) has studied with lutenists Paul O'Dette, Toyohiko Satoh, and Hopkinson Smith. He holds the position of Adjunct Professor of Lute at the College of Saint Scholastica. In 1984, he performed in the First International Lute Competition in Toronto. Having extensively performed throughout the United States, Martin has made recordings for Minnesota Public Radio, and these performances have also been broadcast on the American Public Radio network.\n\nHe is a member of various ensembles, a duo with tenor William Bastian, a baroque lute duo with lutenist Paul Berget, and Duo Chambure with lutenist Phil Rukavina. In the summer of 1997 and 2001 he was invited to be the Renaissance lute instructor at the SFEMS Renaissance week at the Dominican College, San Rafael, California. He has frequently been guest lecturer, teacher, and performer at annual summer seminar of the Lute Society of America, and serves on its Board of Directors. Ed Martin is widely known for his recordings here on Magnatune.\n\nPhillip Rukavina (alto vihuela) has performed both nationally and internationally as a lute and vihuela soloist, ensemble performer, and as a continuo lutenist. He studied lute with Hopkinson Smith at the Academie Musical in Villecroze, France and in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nPhil is a founding member of the Venere Lute Quartet and Duo Chambure, with fellow vihuelista Edward Martin. Duo Chambure has recorded the entire Vihuela duets of Enriquez Valderrabano here on Magnatune. Phillip is also a regular guest instrumentalist with the early vocal group the Rose Ensemble. He has performed with numerous instrumental ensembles, including the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the New World Symphony, Ars Antiqua, and the Lyra Concert Baroque Orchestra, to name a few. He directed the Lute Society of America's Summer Program at the Amherst Early Music Festival in 2005, 2007, and 2009 and he regularly teaches on the faculty of the Lute Society of America's Summer Seminar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He directed the LSA Summer Seminar in 2008 and 2010 and will do so again in 2012.\n\nRockford Mjos (tenor vihuela) performs as a soloist on lute, Baroque guitar and theorbo and contributes to ensemble productions with his performing skills, sensitive accompaniment, and broad repertoire knowledge. In the Netherlands he co-founded The Beggar's Banquet, an innovative ensemble which often created their own arrangements of Baroque popular music and which was showcased at the Dutch Embassy in London.\n\nHis exploration of early music sources has resulted in countless performances of little-known compositions and modern editions. Mjos has concertized thoughout northern Europe and the midwest United States, at early music festivals in Utrecht, Wroclaw, and San Antonio, and has broadcast on Minnesota Public Radio and Dutch National Radio. He studied at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague where he worked principally with Toyohiko Satoh. In addition, Mjos has been honored with numerous national awards for his graphic design work.\n\nTyler Kaiser (bass vihuela) was born in Duluth, Minnesota and has composed, performed, taught and lived in this area longer than some would consider prudent. So, most of his credentials are from this area because he likes to serve his community but, he has received numerous grants, commissions and awards from organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Composers Forum, the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers, the McKnight Foundation and many others.\n\nHe has had some works published by Wolfhead Music in the U.S.A. and by Edition Corvus in Germany. His catalog of compositions includes two comic operas (working on a third), two symphonies, numerous works for orchestra, concert band, chamber ensembles and numerous arrangements for assorted early instruments. As a performer he has been involved with many of the organizations of the Duluth area including the Duluth-Superior Symphony Orchestra, the Lake Superior Chamber Orchestra, the Northland Opera Theater Experience, Lyric Opera of the North, the Center for Early Music Orchestra, the Arrowhead Chorale, Colder by the Lake Comedy Troupe, the Northshore Big Band, and numerous faculty recitals at the College of St. Scholastica and the University of Wisconsin, Superior - both institutions where he also teaches.\n\nSoprano Carrie henneman Shaw, winner of the 2010-2011 McKnight Artist Fellowships for Performing Musicians administered by MacPhail Center for Music, has made her mark as a singer who brings a sense of adventure and style to the concert stage. Acclaimed as a \"major musical force\" (St. Paul Pioneer Press), Shaw collaborates with organizations across the country, such as Boston Early Music Festival, The Newberry Consort, LIBER, dal Niente New Music, The Rose Ensemble and the Bach Society of Minnesota, and is co-artistic director of St. Paul-based Glorious Revolution Baroque.\n\nAs a soloist, Shaw avidly explores both virtuoso avant-garde chamber music and seventeenth-century vocal works with equal passion. Carrie holds a doctorate of musical arts from the University of Minnesota, undergraduate degrees in music and English from Lawrence University, and has served as an instructor at the national Lute Society of America conference in Cleveland.",

The infectious grooves and luscious melodies, topped by Laurie's unforgettable, five octave range voice, define CHIWAWA's unmistakable sound. Some call it post modern post punk electro-acoustic hybrid. Others call it simply Rock or Pop.\n\nIn studio, CHIWAWA plays vocals, bass, guitars, synths, drums and percussion. They can be experimental at times in their songwriting, but always have an ear for a good catchy pop tune. On stage, CHIWAWA electrifies as a duo as well as a full 4-5 piece band.\n\nPlayers:\nLaurie Gordon - vocals, keyboards\nKrassy Halatchev - bass, vocals, percussion, guitar, programming\nChristina Dupre - guitar, vocals\n\nCHIWAWA is a rock/pop electronic duo with Laurie Gordon (vocals, keyboards, guitars, bass, toys), the daughter of Hungarian immigrants, and Krassy Halatchev (bass, vocals, guitars. drums, knobs), born and raised in Communist Bulgaria.\n\nCHIWAWA's sound is a fluctuating mood, a wave of changing winds, polarity in vast directions pointing to a single target - harmony! Lead vocals are equally distributed between the male and female singers. Instrumentation goes from sparse and gentle to abundant and manic. The band's forte is heavy grooves and visceral adhesive melodies. On stage, CHIWAWA electrifies with two or three, or four or more bodies, dabbling with instruments and computers, topped with a solo violin or a trumpet.\n\nLaurie met Krassy in 1991 when she answered a classified ad which read: \"International Band Seeks Female Vocalist.\" What \"International\" really meant was four young Bulgarian immigrant musicians defecting Communist Bulgaria in a band called Ping-Pong. With Laurie they became Short Confession. Within three months of their meeting, Krassy was being deported and Laurie had \"no choice\" but to save the band. What started out as a \"greencard marriage\" blossomed from desperate measures into true love; Laurie and Krassy settled into the Bohemian culture of Montreal, Canada. in 1994 Laurie started her own band CHIWAWA with Luc St. Pierre (keyboards, programming). Krassy, now playing in The Clouds (former Ping Pong), filled in as a drummer for CHIWAWA. A couple of years later he became a permanent member (bass, programming). Soon after Eric Willis (guitars) also joined the band. CHIWAWA's debut album, \"The Sick World Of Yona\", was released in 1998; produced by Steve Whitfield (The Cure, The Mission), it quickly became a hit with the critics.\n\nDespite a diagnosis with early breast cancer a week before the debut release, Laurie continued to perform and front CHIWAWA, writing songs and releasing Chimeres (2002), Bright (2005), Always About You (2007) and Bus Stop Chinese Buffet (2009). Laurie came through louder and bolder then ever and made a full recovery. CHIWAWA continued to write songs (not all released) with different songwriters and musicians, including Camelle Hinds (Paul Weller) Russ Broom (Jann Arden) and UK garage king Mikey Benn.\n\nThe duo also worked with the late Oscar nominated animator Ryan Larkin on his final animation film \"Spare Change\", which Laurie directed on Ryan's behalf after his death in 2007. Ryan was considered \"the Frank Zappa of animation.\" Laurie's company MusiVision and The National Film Board of Canada were the producers of \"Spare Change\", which is based on Ryan's experience as a panhandler begging for spare change on the streets of Montreal. Ryan moved in with CHIWAWA in the last years of his life and came back to his art. A feature documentary film of how Ryan Larkin and CHIWAWA became friends, and together performed a small miracle will air on CTV Television early 2011. Delicious CHIWAWA music is featured in both films.\n\nCHIWAWA's latest album Watermark was released in 2010. The first two singles from it (\"Don't Twist My Mind\" and \"Calma Calma\") are already making waves on the radio.\n\nCurrently CHIWAWA is scoring the soundtrack for academy award winner Co Hoedeman's new animation film \"55 Socks\".

    "description": "virtuoso performances of Bach on unaccompanied flute",
    "bio": "Born in London in 1953 but now living in Oxford, Chris Britton's flute-playing career has been very diverse, ranging from orchestral playing to solo performances in such glorious settings as Christ Church in Oxford. His early training (which also featured bassoon studies) was at the Royal College of Music, London, for which he won a scholarship, then academic study at the University of Birmingham (music and German), but majoring in performance in his final year.\n\nHe has been a student in private lessons and masterclasses of such distinguished flautists as James Galway, Susan Milan, Peter-Lukas Graf, Atarah Ben-Tovim, Graham Mayger and Peter Lloyd. He freelanced with BBC orchestras, appearing as a concerto soloist and broadcasting frequently on BBC Radio 3. He has played under eminent conductors such as Rudolf Schwarz, Norman Del Mar, Richard Hickox and George Hurst. More recently, alongside a busy and successful career as a flute and recorder teacher, he has been active in diverse forms of chamber music: with the Pavlova Wind Quintet, duos with the guitarist Raymond Burley and with the percussionist Keith Fairbairn.\n\nRecent concerts have featured him in events as extraordinary as appearing with the Oxford Trobadors in performances of Occitan songs, in a prison with his wind quintet, and improvising with the ex-Swingles Singer Wendy Nieper! He also enjoys playing Latin-American songs with his trio Serendipity (flute, guitar and percussion).\n\nChris has long been fascinated by the idea of re-arranging music from its original format. Having grown up during the era of 'switched-on' Bach (Jacques Loussier, Swingle Singers, Modern Jazz Quartet and others) he soon became aware of the exciting possibilities of hearing early music presented in a new way. Well-known precedents for this are Bach's re-arrangement of Vivaldi's string concertos for harpsichord, and Mozart's re-working of Bach's preludes and fugues for string quartet. Chris is currently working on arrangements of keyboard music for his wind quintet. As a keen pianist and harpsichordist he has perhaps greater access to unusual early and more recent compositions that a more conventional wind-player may not be aware of. He is also about to record an album of Bach pieces that he and Raymond Burley have arranged for flute and guitar.\n\nApart from arranging, Chris is concerned to give his instrument genuine solo stature. The flute has long been recognised as an important orchestral instrument, but it was only in the late 20th century that solo flute recitals became the norm. Even so, flautists suffer the frustration that much of their repertoire is second-rank compared to the great masterworks for piano or violin.\n\nHaving heard a performance of Bach's Chaconne for solo violin while at university, which seemed to create an entire orchestra from 4 strings and one player, he felt the flute could do something similar, especially the modern Boehm-system flute with its extended range of notes and tone-colours. Bach himself obviously thought highly of the flute and wrote much of its greatest repertoire (solo sonatas, trio sonatas, obligatos in choral works, concertos), no doubt inspired by the recent great improvements in the construction of the instrument and the presence of virtuosos like Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin and Johann Joachim Quantz. With that in mind, his approval of this album is not impossible to imagine.",

For the film music fans in the group, Field's composition \"Gothic Power\" was used in the trailers for the Lord of the Rings series. Field composed \"The Vision\" which was also featured in film trailer Atonement.\n\nAbout this album, Chris says:\n\n\"It's about what's going on behind our thoughts, our sub-conscious. I like to sleep with music very low and once in a while I find my mind halfway between awake and asleep. I feel and perceive things much differently then and can get a much stronger perception of my spirit. Maybe its something like meditation, I don't know. I tried to capture that in this music.\n\nAlso, because its not created for film or picture, I had to draw from my own experience. I wanted a smooth arc in the music so that it wouldn't be startling for the listener. It builds smoothly to the peaks. This is something I noticed when falling asleep to music. If there are too many abrupt dynamics, it can be jolting.\n\nAt the same time, I wanted to keep it exciting when listening at louder volumes. I think this is what, to me, makes new age music unique. It has a smooth flow. There are lots of influences on this album: classical, rock, jazz and cinema, etc., but I applied the new age feeling to it.\"\n\nSub-Conscious was awarded Best Neo-Classical Album, 2006.",

Christopher has worked on a wide variety of projects from film scores to pop albums to video games to theme parks. Christopher is pioneering in the field of guitar synthesis. Some of the exceptional musicians Christopher has had the privilege of working with include Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, Paul Simon, Meatloaf, Luther Vandross, Denny Seiwell, Jennifer Batten, Sheryl Crow, Jimmy Smith, Stevie Wonder, Allan Holdsworth, Stryper, Dokken, and Stanley Clark.\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON - BAD\nChristopher Currell performed the Synclavier, Digital Guitar, and many special effects on this award winning album. Christopher also helped arrange the hit \"BAD\" along with Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones. Christopher also played Synclavier and Digital Guitar on Michael Jackson's \"BAD\" world tour.\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON - HISTORY\nChristopher has also contributed to Michael Jackson's album \"HISTORY.\" Christopher's listed album credits include: Rhythm Arrangements, Synclavier, Guitars and Percussion.\n\nNEW DIRECTIONS\nSince working with Michael Jackson, Christopher has pursued questions concerning the basis of the subjective and objective nature that sound has on the human mind and physical system. Most importantly, how sound can link the human mind and spirit to universal consciousness. Christopher has discovered that the answers to these questions are to be found in the area of quantum physics...more specifically, having to do with Quantum Holography and phase-conjugate-adaptive-resonance (PCAR). This research has cumulated in the form of his music project called ishwish, also available on Magnatune.\n\nMUSICAL ADVENTURES\nChristopher likes to create music also as an art form as well as a spiritual adventure. Between his research and live performances of ishwish, Christopher creates and produces various personal, experimental and artistic music projects. These activities are accessible as Christopher's solo projects, the first being released as \"Heart Sutra.\"\n\nCurrently, Christopher resides in Japan where he lives and creates in the mountains and forest overlooking the ocean and Mount Fuji.",

    "bio": "Oakland California native Christopher Ferreira first foray into the arts came in the form of musical theatre in high school. His early experiences of working, singing, and acting with the many talented people he found himself surrounded by in the drama department forged his love for the arts and paved the way for his future in musical composition.\n\nIn his early twenties, finding himself more and more drawn to music, Ferreira jumped at the chance when a friend's parents offered him their piano. From that moment on, the piano became a major source of inspiration for him. This led to the pursuit of an education in music and the private study of the piano at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He began composing and recording music not only for the piano, but guitar and other instruments as well. When a friend heard some of his recordings and asked him to write music for a short film he had directed, it was to be the first of many such projects.\n\nFerreira began composing music for student films, theatre, web projects, dance, industrial commercials and smaller independent features. In 2004 Ferreira scored his first major independent feature film Illusion starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Michael Goorjian.\n\nFollowing Illusion, Ferreira resumed his education with a formal study of harmony and counterpoint. This led to the writing of Two Worlds Apart, an orchestral piece written for and performed by the Berkeley Youth Orchestra.\n\nHe also worked with American Zoetrope, providing music for Coda: Thirty Years After, a documentary on Francis Coppola and the making of his film Youth Without Youth. His latest film project was an original musical score for the movie The Shift, starring metaphysical author Wayne Dyer. The soundtrack for the film was released in 2009 and has enjoyed success selling worldwide.\n\nFerreira's experience in film is not limited to music composition. He has worked in film as an actor, set designer, boom operator, as well as a variety of roles in post production sound. He was the production designer as well as an actor in the film Groove, which was sold at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000 and distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Classics.\n\nHe worked on the first American Dogma95 film Amerikana, starring James Duval and Michael Goorjian. He also starred in the role of \"Jesus\" in the short film Ripple which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000.\n\nRecently, Ferreira completed his very first solo piano album, The Piano Pieces. It is a collection of solo piano works that span many years of his writing for the piano. It was recorded at Skywalker Sound by Grammy award winning engineer Leslie Ann Jones. The completion of this record fulfills a long held dream of Christopher's. He is currently planning a series of recitals to celebrate and promote the release of the album.",

    "bio": "An exciting blend of acoustic cello and effects opens the door on the music genre, \"electro-acoustic-ambient\" . Cellist Claire Fitch is always eager to introduce new sounds and possibilities to the worlds of ambient music and classical music. Influenced by working with some of Irelands best musicians in 2007, Celocity is the result of inspiration and creative free thinking.\n\nCelocity was recorded at the Fitchsounds studio, which overlooks the Cooley Peninsula and is situated at the edge of the Boyne Valley. The energy created by this magical place is evident in the influence of ancient and modern celtic Ireland. Claire uses a Thomas Smith cello which was made in 1774.\n\n\"Playful melancholy\" is how Celocity has been described. The core of which draws on a rhythmic energy not previously seen in the other Ambiencellist releases. Take a musical journey into the world of acoustic-electric cello soundscapes. Let your consciousness be awakened by the hypnotic sound of Claire Fitch's cello playing.\n\nTwo other albums, Ambiencellist and Ambiencellist Part II, are also available\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Claire Fitch\n\nClaire Fitch started to play the cello at 14, then studied at Birmingham Conservatoire and the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nThe Ambiencellist project was started in 2002 and currently has 2 CDs and 1 digital download in it's catalogue. Written and produced by Claire Fitch, they are closely linked to the summer and winter solstice and are evocative of the magic of ancient celtic Ireland.\n\nAs a recording artist she has contributed to various film soundtracks, such as The Tailor of Panama, The Tie That Binds, The Boxer, Some Mothers' Son, War Of The Buttons, Thumbelina and Lassie. Claire owns a music production company www.fitchsounds.com and has written music for games, film, corporate video, theatre and television.\n\nClaire Fitch has performed on stage and in the studio with artists such as U2, Kate Bush, The Corrs, Shania Twain, Riverdance, Elmer Bernstein, Brian Kennedy and Smokey Robinson. In 2007 Claire toured with jazz singer Dorothy Murphy and, more recently in 2008, with Carmel Conway.\n\nClaire works with the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland, the Orchestra of Saint Cecilia and the Irish Film Orchestra.\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Instruments\n\nThe Thomas Smith cello was made in 1774, in a pub called the \"Harp and Hautbois\" in Pall Mall, London. \"Hautbois\" is French for \"Oboe\" and the original label can still be seen inside. To put it's age into perspective, in 1774 Handels' Messiah had just been written, Louis XVI was on the Throne in France and Captain Cook was exploring the world.\n\nIn 1989 the cello was sitting in a cupboard in Birmingham, England. It was covered in spots of white emulsion paint, badly damaged and not getting much attention. My parents approached the owner to buy the cello, but the deal was that they had to pay for another cello to be refurbished at the same time. So we took advice from J & A Beare in London and decided it was well worth the risk. Four months later a totally refurbished Thomas Smith was carried out of the repair shop. It had been bought back to life and I've been playing it constantly ever since.\n\nThe sound is rich and mellow, a constant pleasure to play. Just to think of the age of the wood is mind blowing, let alone the other cellists that might have played it. I have an aim to try and find out the history of it at some point, there needs to be some serious research done.\n\nI use Belcanto Gold strings, have fitted a Big Twin, K & K Pickup and have a Stahlhammer endpin.\n\nThe computer I use for music making is a Mac G5 Dual 2ghz with 4gb RAM. I write and improvise using Logic Studio software and a variety of software synthesizers and effects. Absynth, to name one, is a software synthesizer built by Brian Clevinger. Sounds that I can only dream of are made possible by the clever programming of sound designers such as Colin Fraser and Tim Conrady. Ben Gillet of Camel Audio has created a beast of an effect in Camelspace, which is total sonic inspiration. Also the guys at Ohmforce need a mention with their wacky, creative effect design. The sounds I play are all routed through these software effects and the results just keep on getting better. Acoustic-Electro-Ambient cello music is born!",

    "bio": "Growing up under the roof of her two fiddle-playing parents in a small town in Austria, music was a central and fundamental part of Claudia Schwab's life from childhood on. At the tender age of three, she took up a three stringed fiddle and started to jam along with radio, LPs, orchestral music, and with her family. At the age of five she finally received her first violin lesson from her mum. Soon after that she enrolled in piano, singing and recorder lessons at the music school next door.\n\nOver the years she performed the roles of first violinist in the youth orchestra, the Joey's Ba-Rock Ensemble, leader of the second violins in the Schweizerorchester Frohnleiten and was involved with the school's vocal ensemble and various choirs. Somewhere in-between she also had a short affair with the trumpet and hip-hop dancing. From the age of 10 until 19 she frequented the Musikgymnasium Dreihackengasse in Graz/ Austria where she found out about voice leading, the circle of fifths and counterpoint and had her first experience of being part of a show in the opera house Graz. As part of the Schweizerorchester, the international YMISO orchestra and the music gymasiums's own orchestra she enjoyed trips to Egypt, California, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Slovenia.\n\nWhilst the initial classical training formed the main part of her music making for many years, during her time at the Musikgymasium Claudia started to become interested in jazz improvisation, Eastern European folk and Irish trad, musics that were played at folk festivals around the area, and got swept away with the Styrian folk music revolution which took Austria by storm, refilling the valleys and mountains with beautiful yodelling and alpine fiddling.\n\nIn 2005, she accidentally emigrated to Ireland to learn some Irish traditional tunes. In her newly found second home Sligo, she got intensely immersed into Irish traditional music. In 2008 she took a trip to India where she started to study North Indian Classical Music with violinist Sukhdev Prasad Mishra. In 2012, Claudia completed her undergraduate arts degree in music and psychology at UCC achieving first class honours, followed by a sponsored masters degree in ethnomusicology which she completed in 2013.\n\nAlongside working on her own solo project which she performed in Ireland, Sweden, Slovenia and Austria, she is currently touring through Switzerland, Germany, Moldova, New York, Austria, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic with Austrian string-trio Netnakisum (AUT), Irish Indie band Tucan (IRE), Marti Taern (EST) and Stefan Hedborg (SE) (Claudia Schwab trio), german Jazz legend Matthias Schriefl, the Cork Gamelan orchestra (IRE) and Scottish fiddle-singer Kate Young (Kate and the Austrian).\n\n'Amber Sands' was released in spring 2014. By now a regular feature on Irish and Austrian national radio programmes, 'Amber Sands' has received great reviews from a variety of magazines such as Songlines, MICA Austria, and the FATEA magazine and has been nominated in 3 categories for the Songlines Music Awards 2015.\n\nYou can find out more about Claudia on her website.",

    "bio": "Robo/human duo Collection Get! sounds like a low-bit star fighter, crashing though a lush palate of hi-fi indie electro textures. Rare vintage synths, nintendos, old computers and an unreasonable pile of live instruments provide the backdrop for Grace Hrabi (vocals + keys) and Eliot Britton (brooding robot voice, beats, bass and synths).\n\nRobot and Girl:\nGrace and Eliot met at music school (University of Manitoba). They were both members of a ten piece ska. During this period they released albums and performed regularly, but more importantly they became friends and realized they share a similar but odd sense of humor. Collection Get! work well together because their contrasting musical backgrounds and approach to music. Eliot's technical skills and robotic approach to rhythm plays well off of Grace's jazz background and ability to breathe attitude and style into the music. Despite their good working/performing relationship, old rivalries often flare up, transforming rehearsals into into gaming sessions where Grace almost always wins. Especially at anything involving puzzles.\n\nCollection Get! was originally conceived as a cartoon project. When they decided to play live shows they realized they couldn't afford on stage holograms. Since they couldn't agree on costumes, they opted to be real people too. They still argue about whether or not Eliot could get away with wearing a transformer helmet... he's keeping his eye out for one and has a plan to re-wire the helmet's mic into a vocoder. Keep an eye out for pictures.\n\nAs for live performance, Grace sings and plays most of the Keys, Eliot takes care of the bass lines, drum machines, turntables and robot voices.\n\nAlbum Origins:\nThe project started in 2009 and grew from 8bit remixes and songs that Eliot started working on with his recording engineer / producer friend Chris Johns.\n\nAfter arguing about the cultural value of \"lofi\" aesthetics, hipsterisim and nostalgia, they came up with a challenging album concept. Other than a cloying cultural reference, what is it about lo-bit sounds that makes them beautiful and worth using? What can you do with these sounds to tell a story, to play with their cultural value and meaning?\n\nThe disparity between hifi / lofi sound sources was a great way to expand the sound palate. Sound quality was used to achieve colours, textures and timbres impossible otherwise.\n\nThis project dragged Collection Get! kicking and screaming away from a purely digital production setup, and triggered their obsession with analog synthesizers and unique DIY sound sources. However, Eliot remains deeply suspicious of the trendy vintage gear, and is only putting up with it until he finds a better digital alternative.\n\nSave As is a very personal and emotional project, despite a light-hearted sound. Generally, the lighter the track, the more tragic the real life circumstance that inspired it. For example, the bright and cheery track 1 is based on one of the most devastating events of Eliot's life.\n\nCurrently:\nEliot:\n-Doing PhD in Music Composition and Research at McGill University.\n-Teaches electronic music production.\n-Trying to figure out how to reconcile my academic and pop music backgrounds.\n-Favorite videogame: Castlevania.\n\nGrace:\n-Jazz singer vocalist based in Winnipeg Manitoba.\n-Designs and produces fashion accessories, and shares her creative sense of style with others.\n-Taking pictures of her cats.\n-Favorite videogame: Dr. Mario.",

I've played country songs on the back of a truck next to a spit-roasting pig; jazz standards at swanky cocktail bars; disco songs in lavishly decorated ballrooms, rock songs in sweaty, seedy cesspools; reggae with the local stoners on the streets of Byron Bay; show tunes for the old folks at RSL clubs; Christmas carols with school kids; soul music in Papua New Guinea at a venue surrounded by shotgun-wielding guards; blues tunes for mafia guests arriving by private helicopter; jaunty theatre numbers in an outback musical complete with horses and motorbike acrobatics.\n\nI've been treated like dirt by the super-rich; treated like a king by those with nothing. I've played to crowds of three and crowds of thousands. I've thrashed drums to within an inch of their life, and I've been told to turn down an acoustic guitar. I really do love the muso life. But up to this point I have always just coasted along as the hired help. Playing for others is easy and fun, but I eventually started wondering if writing and recording my own music could be even more satisfying.\n\nSo, this music is what I've kept to myself the whole time.

    "bio": "Imagine, what if Nine Inch Nails,Metallica, King Crimson, Ozzy, Sabbath, Nirvana, The Beatles, Zeppelin, Cheap Trick, Van Halen, Stone Temple Pilots, Steve Vai, Beethoven, My Chemical Romance and Frank Zappa were all thrown into a blender with some Tequila and strawberries... Then add a bong hit or two... That just BEGINS to tell the story...\n\nHold on to your hats because the roller coaster is going off the tracks... Michael Trapp, a.k.a. Mike E.T., a.k.a. The Alien, a.k.a. Captain Freak is a \"serious musician.\" For whatever absurd reason - this label has had almost evil overtones in the 90's and even into the new millennium.\n\nHe has attended Mannes College of Music in Manhattan and graduated Berklee College of Music in Boston. For those 4 years he focused exclusively on practicing and writing music. After graduation he played in some heavy progressive chops bands in N.Y.C. and L.A. such as Danse Macabre, DreamSpeak, The Fringe and Dreamer. All broke up due to internal differences just as they were getting press and an audience. Fed up with bands in general he became a hired gun, becoming the 2nd guitarist in Eddie Ojeda's (Twisted Sister) band.\n\nHe bought his own crappy studio and recorded \"The Furious Guitar\" demo which was featured in a Guitar Player's magazine piece. In the 90's Mike met his dream vocalist Matt Wells. He joined Matt's band Bad Habit - a pure power pop outfit with heavy arena rock overtones; then came Nirvana and the band disintegrated after being offered a minor record deal. In retrospect Mike E.T. is thankful Bad Habit never made it. Nirvana opened up a whole new can of worms man, and that was right after hearing Nine Inch Nails for the first time. I was never gonna be the same person. Matt and Mike then went on to record an album for there own selfish purposes and Bliss(This)' \"Chasing the Mad Rabbit\" was born. Unfortunately for Bliss(This), just as positive reviews and feedback were heading the bands way, Michael's ex-wife was stricken with a serious illness and the music had to be put on hold. During that time, he wrote and demoed the entire \"Captain Freak\" album. With Mike's ex-wife's illness finally in check he bought a new studio and started recording. But then Matt's wife became pregnant and Mike was pushed into handling all the vocal and instrumental duties. \"F*** it,\" said Trapp, \"I'll change the name of the band to CrimsonFaced and take over the f***ing world anyway.\" During this dark period of his life Mike also re-wrote and re-arranged and added new songs to \"The Furious Guitar\" - A 13-song instrumental guitar CD that is one part genius/one part insanity. Fans of over the top guitar playing and amazing instrumental melodies will be FLOORED. It was also during this period that Mike met the beautiful and talented Cash Casia; he was hired for some NYC showcases and recorded on her demo currently being shopped to major labels.\n\nIn 2005, Mike E.T. now of CrimsonFaced released the stunning \"Captain Freak\" CD. 13 songs of rock and roll majesty, a tapestry of rock's powerful take no prisoners history. Bored of all the nameless faceless rock of the new decade the Alien gave music's boring landscape a serious kick in the ass. And now in 2009 OMFG can it be can it be? The long awaited follow up to \"Captain Freak\" is FINALLY HERE! WTF was Mike E.T. doing over these last 4 years? Geez, you would think a musician that locks himself up in his Sober Sucks Studios would come out once and a while to play - but not Mike E.T. The Alien was lovingly caressing his guitar strings in the most god awful perverted way. His poor keyboard was banged and hammered from one end of the studio to the other. Between writing music for a futuristic CGI movie still in development and adding some cool tunes to a soon to be filmed PORNO (hehe, I said porno ;-))) Mike E.T., between psychotherapy sessions with his mixer/therapist Paul Kurzweil, wrote and recorded 18 songs, 13 of which come together on the deliciously demented and aptly titled \"Lunatic Binge.\" Whereas \"Captain Freak\" was mostly in your face the entire CD, \"Lunatic Binge\" veers from sick rock and roll to melodic musings about life. Think Trent Reznor meets the Bee Gees; after a drug binge. Think Pink Floyd for the 21st Century. Think Ozzy and a sequencer doing battle for each others' soul.\n\nMike E.T. hopes you enjoy his creation. He poked his head out of his studio to give the world Lunatic Binge, and now he has once again crawled into his studio, locked the door, put a huge dresser against the door, and has imprisoned himself with 50 cases of Corona, 5 bottles of Patron, 5 guitars and 12 Virgins. See you in 2 or 3 years...\n\nBrief Mike E.T. Interview\n\nWhy the name CrimsonFaced?\nAhhhhhhh... That one's easy... CrimsonFaced is a loving tip off the hat to my need for Samuel Adams Light, Jose Cuervo Gold, and Frey Vineyards Merlot!!!\n\nDo you play live?\nNot at this time. If there is a demand for it I will hire a band and get to it. I am a very spiritual and whacked out of my head performer. The stage is a whole different ballgame than the studio. I feel like an uncaged wild animal when I perform... been known to have sex with my guitar on stage!\n\nHow, do you think, does the internet (or mp3's) change the music industry?\nThe internet is the single greatest thing for the musician.... EVER!!!! F*** the record companies and their endless stream of sound-alike bands. F*** the no talent pretty boys and girls who saturate MTV. I care about the songs. If they are great you have my attention. Anything less and I'll pass.\n\nWould you sign a record contract with a major label?\nI highly doubt it. It would have to be on my terms... and I doubt that would be o.k. with any label.",

    "description": "deeply ambient new music",
    "bio": "I have always had trouble describing my work.\n\nThe problem is partly due to the fact that no easy 'pigeonhole' seems to exist for the music that I create. Some have tried to call it 'New Age'...but often it has too many abrasive elements, dark tones, and sometimes actual noise to fit that. Others have considered it 'Space Music'...which is a bit closer, although I'm not exactly sure what space my work would be describing. 'Ambient' therefore seems to fit best, as it does tend to be music that's suitable for a 'backdrop'...but at the same time, music that also describes a certain 'ambiance'. Music that's a snapshot of sorts of places, feelings, sensations, states of mind, and the like.\n\nYears and years ago, around the same time I was first learning piano as a small child, I also encountered the shortwave radio. It fascinated me...this box of strange sounds, pulsations, voices from other places phasing in and out. And then later in the 1960s, I heard the first stirrings of the Moog synthesizer...and others as well, as I attended a concert given by David Rosenboom while still in the second grade, with him performing his meditative style of electronics on a massive ARP 2500 rig. I suppose it was that formative experience that cemented what I was to try and do in my life.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, I encountered a number of important musical 'signposts'...the work of Eno, Stockhausen, Cage, the music of the 'Krautrock' and punk scenes, and so on. All of these were, I think, important musical influences because they were not so much music that I only listened to, but music that made me want to try and do what I was hearing in it. I banged around some with some industrial/noise ideas, worked some in the early phases of the punk scene in Nashville (and yes, we did have one there), but it was also during this same period, around 1979-1980, that I started tinkering with tapes, delays, simple synths and sometimes just raw electronics. Everything that goes up to now seems to stem from there.\n\nI studied composition at Middle Tennessee State, under Dr. Thom Hutcheson, to whom I'm forever indebted because he allowed me a massive amount of rein to experiment in the electronic music studios there...as well as the commercial studios which were very much on par with typical industry-standard facilities of the day. These were critical times, with Hutch allowing me to try as much as I could, making important mistakes alongside successes. Later on, I studied under John Anthony Lennon at Tennessee, then with Salvatore Martirano at Illinois...both while I was in attendance there, and then off and on privately after a little 'falling-out' I had over some aesthetic differences with the rest of the composition faculty there. Sal taught me one thing that's been important...trust instinct and a belief in yourself and in your music. And from the early 1990s on, I have. Very much so.\n\nI went on from there, gradually building up a studio from a room-corner pile of gear into what I have now, which is requiring the complete remodeling of the walk-up attic of our rural home. In a decade's time, it grew like topsy. As did my music, as I explored deeper and deeper introspections in my 'ambient' work, and I explored the ranges of rhythmic expression in early IDM-style techno. But throughout both, there was and still is a strain of sound that owes its origins to the avant-garde. I have never really gotten away from it, and I don't think it would be in my best interests to try. It's the little bit of cayenne pepper that adds a 'zing' to what would otherwise be a typical dish. And given that I like spicy things, well...\n\nIn the past few years, I also was privileged to study with Karlheinz Stockhausen, at his Courses for New Music in Germany. It was not so much an experience of learning basics, but an affirmation that I was pursuing the right directions. Everything that he said or discussed, I already believed or had arrived at a similar conclusion myself. It was very liberating, I said at the time, and from those days on, I've felt a freedom to take what I feel, hear, envision, and set this down as best I can, following instinct, capturing the immediate 'now' of a work.\n\nAnd it's that 'now'...that is the key here. Framing the 'now', following a sense of the true nature of things, relying on instinct and a fluid mind...all of these things are my guideposts, along with so many things I've heard and experienced. Works that capture a certain 'now', such as \"Mendota\" and its impression of sunset colors sliding across a vast frozen lake and snowscape...or \"SPCTR\", which attempts to magnify the 'world inside a single tone'...these and so many other 'nows' are the ones I try to paint as best as I can in the sounds that I use. And perhaps the results evoke other things, as everyone's experience of something as fundamentally communicating as music is colored by their own experiences in so many ways.\n\nIn Zen disciplines, one hears of the concept of 'samu'...work as meditation or practice. And I view what I do, when I'm creating or performing, or even tweaking the settings on an existing work...as a manner of that same practice. But it's a practice with an open mind, receptive, waiting for something to sound from beyond the fundamental self and not merely 'just doing something, no matter what'. Creativity within a mindful state, and continuously trying to seize the 'now' in a work...it's not the easiest way I can think of to work, nor the easiest way that I have worked over the years. But it is the right way for me, as trying to be a 'New Music star' only ever led to a lot of ego-driven angst and annoyance. That's not who I am, not my nature, not my music.\n\nWhere from here, then? Who can say? Not me. None of those 'nows' have happened yet, so I suppose I'll simply have to wait for them so that I can encounter each one. I encourage you to wait and see what happens, as well.",

    "bio": "dammerson vaughan, like so many electronic musicians of this era, came of age as a rock musician. In college at Chico, CA, dammerson decided it would be cool to be in a rock band, play gigs, tour in vans and meet girls. He was right. It was cool.\n\nTalented but untrained, dammerson taught himself to play the bass guitar by playing along to Bruce Thomas's bass lines on early Elvis Costello records. This proved to be a highly effective method because within months he was proficient enough to audition for and join the popular local band, The Downsiders. The Downsiders went on to record several albums for Black Park and Mammoth Records, though dammerson had left to pursue his own vision of self-recording.\n\ndammerson bought one of the earliest TASCAM semi-pro multitrack recorders and began teaching himself to manage signal flow, lay down tracks, overdubs and build songs playing all of the parts himself. In 1990 Devil in the Woods Records released a cassette-only album of his original material under the name The Opaque. This release was favorably reviewed both locally in the Chico News and Review and nationally in Option Magazine.\n\ndammerson missed playing live and joined two other Chico bands, Goodbye Johnny (Richard Buckner's first band) and These Days, who became a premier local band with a loyal following. These Days was shopping around a polished 4-song demo and came very close to signing a recording contract before lead guitarist John McKinley's erratic behavior caused the band to disband.\n\nBy the late 90's dammerson had moved to Seattle and in 1999 with the advent of Pro Tools entry-level 32 track digital system the digi 001 and the introduction of the Mac G4, dammerson made the move from analog multitrack to digital recording and never looked back. dammerson built a home studio and began mastering records for local independent artists while himself mastering the art of digital composition techniques and new software such as Ableton Live, Propellerheads Reason and eMagic Logic.\n\ndammerson's compositions are primarily instrumental, moody and evocative and perfect for film/video application. His vision was to begin placing songs in TV shows and independent films. He eventually placed several pieces in industrial videos by UK director Grant Pollard, formerly of BBC TV.\n\nCurrently dammerson licenses songs for use by independent video producers to use royalty-free and continues to look for collaborations with film directors.",

    "description": "colorful classical guitar",
    "bio": "Daniel Estrem began his musical practice on keyboard at age 5 with the urging of his parents. In 1960 the fire for classical guitar was ignited after hearing a Segovia recording. He began study of the guitar at age 11 with Dr. James Condell, a teacher of classical and jazz guitar in Moorhead, MN. Living 60 miles away in Fergus Falls, the determined young student would ride the train to Moorhead every other Saturday for lessons. The luring attraction of the rock band era forged by the Beatles in the mid-60's consequently led him to electric guitar and the dissection of popular songs. This rather basic skill learned at an early age has proved very useful later in life with more complex musical forms.\n\nEstrem later studied classical guitar with Jeffrey Van in St. Paul, MN, and taught classical guitar at Macalester College, Augsburg College, and Hamline University in Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN. His affection for classical, jazz, world, popular, blues, and early music has made his performances somewhat difficult to classify. Rather than remain strictly within one genre he prefers to perform and arrange pieces from a variety of sources. He keeps an ever-changing repertoire on 8 and 6-string classical guitars, 7 and 6-string acoustic guitars, 7- string jazz guitar, electric bass, 8-course renaissance lute, tenor ukulele, sarod and bouzouki.\n\nEstrem is best known for his recorded guitar duet work with John Holmquist. Their first LP recording, Music of Edvard Grieg (on the Cavata label) consists of Estrem's transcriptions of 11 Lyric Pieces and the Holberg Suite, published by Music of the Americas. He was the arranger and producer of 5 CDs of jazz standards recorded with Holmquist on the Projazz label which were distributed internationally. The duo concertized extensively for many years and performed on NPR's \"St. Paul Sunday\" program, a nationwide broadcast. They had the opportunity to play for Segovia while the maestro dined at a private home after giving a concert. He seemed unfamiliar with the duet repertoire and kept requesting more music (as he consumed his steak).\n\nIn 1978 Estrem graduated from the University of Minnesota Dental School and the evening of graduation gave a solo concert at Macalester College. The concert hall date had to be reserved 9 months in advance and the Dental School only announced its graduation day 6 months in advance. Although the over-scheduled day was somewhat of a coincidence, a friend commented that this was a sign that music would continue to be a passionate force for many years to come.\n\nEstrem says, \"listening to good music is fine, and can be very moving, but I love to play it. The musical vibrations going through my body somehow make me feel better and more alive. It's especially magical when a musician is able to get into that \"zone\" where technique simply flows and time is suspended. There was a now-defunct music store in the Twin Cities that had as its motto, If you really Love music ---Play It. Of course, they had an ulterior motive, but I always liked that phrase. I love intimate music....solos, duets, trios or quartets. It's possible to get a good look into the soul of the artist with a small ensemble. There is no language like music when it comes to expressing emotions.\"\n\nOne of Daniel's previous releases on Magnatune was \"Edvard Grieg\" a re-release of a recording made in 1980. On it Daniel collaborates with John Holmquist, together they performed as a duo until 1988. John won first prize at the Guitar 78 International Competition in Toronto and a Solo Recitalist Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has toured extensively and recorded several outstanding solo CDs. He was the head of the guitar department at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music in Milwaukee as well as the head of the guitar programme at the Cleveland Institute of Music.",

He has also been recognized internationally for his ambient guitar work through radio and other media outlets.\n\nPreston's first ambient music release, \"BE\" gained national radio play through NPR and international radio syndication through Radio Despi (Spain) and Echoes (USA), \"BE\" debuted in September 2008 at 91 on the New Age Reporter Charts. The following month, after continued heavy rotation on an increasing amount of radio stations and syndicated shows, \"BE\" shot up the charts to 66.\n\n\"(Preston's) music ends up being some of the most inspirational and thought provoking ambient work we've ever heard...In other words, if you aren't familiar with this ground breaking artist yet, you will be in the very near future.\"\n- Jason Schleweis / Crush Music Magazine\n\nThe second ambient release from Dave Preston, \"Soundtrack For Motion\" is a meditation of motion and movement in all it's forms, both physical and metaphysical. As he did in his ambient debut \"Be\", Preston intricately weaves uncommon intensity and passion into the sonic landscape and manages to accomplish something rare: ambient music that is capable of a wide range of feelings. From the transcendent \"Blind Lovers Hand In Hand\", the near sacred rage of \"The Blood In Your Veins, and the wailing of \"A Giant Leap Of Faith\" to the \"Blade Runner\" atmospherics of \"Spinning Away From The Earth\" (a collaboration with Mingo), \"Soundtrack For Motion\" shows significant growth and maturing of Preston as an ambient artist.\n\n\"It is his creative and unique talents that will undoubtedly one day earn him praise for his incredible scores for major motion pictures, worthy of Academy Awards.\"\n- Chris Vetrano / Tragic Kingdom / Idol Insider\n\nIn 2008, after Tennman/Interscope recording artist Matt Morris asked Preston to join his band, Morris and Preston began shaping \"BE-JOY\" (third track from \"BE\") from an ambient soundscape, into a melodic, pulse driven POP song. Co-produced by Justin Timberlake, \"Just Before The Morning\" (Matt Morris/\"When Everything Breaks Open\") carries charting promise and marks the beginning of a writing friendship.\n\nYou can read more about Dave on his website.",

I grew up travelling around the UK, exposed to both modern jazz and the folk traditions of Europe and Ireland.\n\nMore importantly, walking around the funfair in full swing of an evening, I would become aware of the stunning ability of pop music to create atmosphere...make memories...provide a soundtrack to live by...a soundtrack that could lift people from mundanity into some kind of transient glamour. As a young boy, there was also an irresistibly sleazy, tense, side to this life. Trying to nail various aspects of that atmosphere musically has become something of a quest, David Lynch being the past-master.\n\nAfter settling in London, I attended art college, then, on the back of a lucky break, started as a session guitarist, both touring and studio. Thanks to a plethora of synth bands needing augmentation, there was plenty of work. From the late 80s to mid 90s I featured on over twenty UK Top 20 singles. I continue to work as a studio-based session guitarist/bassist. Since the late 90s I've been working with various dance companies. Writing for choreography is a rare honour and to see one's work interpreted physically is, to my mind, the ultimate pay-off.\n\n'An Ecstasy Of Fumbling' is a soundtrack project, initially conceived to provide music for a specific movie, now expanded to include all soundtrack work and allowing me to indulge in my heroes, John Barry, John Martyn, Angelo Badalamenti, Pentangle, Peter Green et al.\n\nMy work is about communicating emotion, mood, atmosphere, tension, intensity, transience, sleaze, hope, loss, instability...film noir is king.",

    "bio": "For over two decades David Gilden has been performing music on the majestic twenty-one string, kora, a harp-lute from West Africa. Gilden first heard the kora in 1978 at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC. At the time, he was studying piano and jazz composition at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nAfter graduating from Berklee 1980, Gilden embarked on his kora studies, becoming the first American student of Gambian griots Dembo Konte and Malamini Jobarteh. Over the next 10 years, Gilden transcribed recordings and took lessons with touring African musicians and received help from ethnomusicology professor Roderic Knight of Oberlin College.\n\nIn 1989, Gilden took his first journey to West Africa to study the kora and interact with local musicians. To date, he has traveled to the region a total of nine times. He has traveled extensively throughout The Gambia. In 1995 on his fifth of nine trips, he traveled to Bamako, Mali, where he lived at the home master guitarist Djelimady Tounkara. During this three-month stay, Gilden studied with kora virtuoso Toumani Diabate, gave a concert ORTM (Malian national television), and honored the first kora player he heard, back in 1978, Batourou Sekou Kouyate.\n\nGilden has released several recordings that have been featured on NPR and on college radio stations throughout North America. He has been interviewed for Leo Sarkisian's popular Voice of America program, Music Time in Africa. The Cora Connection web site went on-line after Gilden returned from this Malian musical adventure back in the spring of '95. During the 90s Gilden performed regularly with his world music group, Cora Connection at New England area festivals, clubs and cultural events. Additionally Cora Connection workshops introduced West Africa and its rich musical traditions at area schools and colleges. In 2002 Gilden relocated to Dallas-Ft. Worth Texas area, where his passion for music and his masterful performance on the kora have found a new audience.\n\nWorld folk music traditions have been a major influence on David Gilden's musical development. Over the past fifteen years, his performances and compositions have evolved to include aspects of African, Celtic and Indian musical traditions. Complementing these ancient elements, Gilden introduces a strong modern flavor in the sound, reflecting his years of work with keyboards and electronic music.\n\nYou can experience more of David's playing on the following YouTube video.",

His albums are lyrical, complex, and invite the listener to join in the exploration of all the beauty to be found within and without one's own being.\n\nDavid's style is all his own, developed over many years as a performer and composer. His work involves various techniques, including finger style, flat-picking, jazz chording, spontaneous improvisation, classical, rock, blues, and folk. David pulls these various elements together in a unique mix that creates a timeless space in sound. Originally self-taught, having picked up an acoustic guitar at the age of 15, David's early influences were Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and The Eagles, as well as jazz and rock guitarists such as George Benson, Pat Metheny and Carlos Santana. He moved on to electric guitar, eventually meeting and forming a band with Master Hammond B3 organist Ike Stubblefield.\n\nIn the late-80s, David's musical direction reached a significant turning point leading to a whole new level of David's personal understanding of life and his musical career as he met inner-life teacher Vernon Howard who lived in Las Vegas, NV. Through his studies of inner transformation, David returned to the naturalness and simplicity of his original love, the acoustic guitar. These double threads of David's life - the inner search and its expression in his music - continue to weave themselves together, as David pursues his inner studies of self-realization and continues to write and perform music that expresses the beauty and wonder of a heart opening itself to the universe.\n\nDavid's music has been used in films by independent film director Ray Nomoto Robison, including The Bag and also Sixes and the One Eyed King, which won the Audience Choice Award at festivals in Miami and Louisville as well as the Best Feature Award at the Rogue Independent Film Festival in Oregon. David's music has also been used to open author Guy Finley's numerous radio programs and multiple audio albums. Actor Desi Arnaz Jr. uses David's music to welcome the audience to shows he produces at his historic Boulder City Theatre in Boulder City, Nevada. Mr. Arnaz says, David's music \"has a wonderful calming effect on people waiting for the show to begin.\"\n\nDavid's style continues to evolve - from acoustic guitar to electric guitar, native american flute, keyboards, percussion and more. David's compositions continue to push the limits on style, sound and originality.\n\nSee David performing Amazing Grace from his album of the same title.\n\nHis latest release \"Angel\" is a mixture of highly textured compositions that weave acoustic and electric guitars in ways that absorb the listener into a space of ambient tranquility. David takes another step into a new direction with his mastery of composition and soundscape. Welcome to the world of David Modica Music.",

An eminent musical figure, he's always left a deep mark in the projects he has been involved in. The innovative sound of his cello is the result of his great sensitivity and tireless research as a composer, cello player, guitarist, and sound engineer.\n\nHe has worked with Antonio Breschi, Gaben Dabire, Radiodervish, Nancy Elizabeth, Nura, and Rene Aubry, to name but a few. Rene Aubry himself was in the band who played Davide's world premiere of Distant City - Viterbo's live act for Time Zones international music festival.\n\nDuring the 80s, Davide was a member of the Skizo, a band whose short life represented a milestone in Italian underground music scene: \"the most innovative act tonight, a band with a sound that's plain and complicated at once, where burning moments follow static ones, really clever.\" (Red Ronnie, Il Resto del Carlino 7/6/82 Festival Rock Bologna).\n\nDavide took his cello diploma at the music academy N. Piccinni under Vito Paternoster's tutoring. He is a cellist for the Orchestra Provincia di Bari. Soon after he won an audition for the Petruzzelli orchestra.

    "bio": "The members of Dayazell play original music, freely inspired by ancient and traditional repertories. From Andalusian Spain to Persia, through Italy, Armenia or Mongolia, Dayazell takes you on a trip toward unrecognized landscapes of world music.\n\nLine-up\nYann Righetti (cistre, oud)\nIsao Bredel (nyckelharpa, voice)\nYann Voegel (flutes, ney,chalumeau, voice)\nGuilhem Puech (darbouka, tar, drum)\n\nCan you describe your music in a few words?\nIsao : To put it in a nutshell we play ancient and traditional world music..\nGuilhem : ..with a small preference for the mediterranean sea, for now.\nYann : It's a \"travelling\" music. A music that is good to listen with your eyes closed.\nNnay : It sounds funny but the music we play is mainly a music we like to play. It takes its roots in tradition as much as in our imaginations.\n\nWhere does the repertory comes from? What are your sources, your inspirations?\nYann : As Guilhem said, the repertory mainly comes from the mediterranean area. Some songs we play come from old manuscripts (European medieval ones, like the \"Cantigas de Santa Maria\", or the \"Llibre Vermell de Montserrat\"), but most of them come from oral transmission.\nNnay : We always seek songs that create an emotion whitin us..\nYann : ..and then we rearange them, with our own sensibility, with our own musical culture.\nIsao : Some artists are also great inspirations, sometimes even direct sources. I'm thinking of bands like \"Oni Wytars\" or \"Accentus\"\nGuilhem : To emphasize what Yann was saying about our musical culture: we do listen to lots of different things, individually, but also together. When we're on tour, the car radio will play jazz, hip hop, post rock, electro. Obvisously, it does influence our music, in a subtil way.\n\nActually how do you create? How do you choose your themes, how do you do the arrangements?\nGuilhem : When we are in a creative process, eveyone proposes themes that they found during their own research. Then we only keep the songs the four of us love. If we work on a theme that has already been recorded by another band, we try to take distance from the existing version. We keep the melody, and force ourselves (when it's possible) to forget about the structural, melodical and rythmical arrangements.\nIsao : We save lot of space for the improvisation, that's often how we appropriate the songs, how we create music \"around\" the original theme..\nYann : ..and our songs do evolve a lot. They are never set in stone. They change, every year, we always look for the more sensitive and the more pertinent version we can offer.\n\nWhat about your musical backgrounds?\nGuilhem : except Nnay we are all autodidacts. So Nnay, you go first!\nNnay : I began the flute in 1994, in a MJC, for four years. Then I continued in an \"Ecole de Musique\" for 7 years. In the same time I experienced jazz music, playing the saxophone. Later on, moving in the south of France, I discovered jazz manouche, Irish music, and traditional French music. I learnt to play the thin whistle with Jacob Fournel, and recently I took some ney lessons with Hristos Barbas.\nYann : As an autodidact, I've played all kinds of stuff; flamenca, country, Irish, medieval. IÔve been involved in different projects, such as \"Kassla Datcha\" (klezmer music) or \"Noon\" (australian folk music). I also worked with other kinds of artists, African story tellers, jugglers. Now I'm taking lessons with Lakdar Hanou, a great oud player from Algeria.\nIsao : Autodidact as well ! I learnt the hindoustani singing with a master in India in 2005 and now I take some lessons with a French teacher, Michele Zini. As far as the nyckelharpa is concerned , I learnt all by myself, playing with other musicians, like Dayazell! And now I may take some lessons with Didier Francois, an amazing nyckelharpa player. He lives in Belgium and is famous, among other things, for his collaboration with Marco Ambrosini.\nGuilhem : Well, as Yann and Isao, I'm mainly autodidact. I've been working on different kind of drums : djembe, cajon, drumset and been involved in different kinds of bands : medieval, post rock, Irish, psychedelic. As far as the Arabic drums are concerned, I've had the chance to take 3 years of lessons with Ali Alaoui, an amazing darbouka player from Morroco. He's been, among other things, solist and arranger for the National Orchestra of Morocco.\n\nTell us about the origins of Dayazell? How did you met? For how long have you been playing together?\nYann : The initial project was a trio, with Baptiste Couget (former flutist of the band), Guilhem and I. At the time I was playing with Baptiste within a musical/theatre company called \"Alchymere\", Baptiste was playing with Guilhem in a post rock band, and Guilhem and I were playing together in an Irish band. We were actually all playing together, but only \"in twos\". The idea came to form a trio.\nGuilhem : Then we met Isao. She had two interesting cards to play : a really perticular way of singing, her own way, really sensitive and an atypical instrument : the nyckelharpa. It \"worked\" really fast, everything was pretty natural.\nNnay : Guilhem and Yann were looking for a flutist, but for their Irish band. That's how they found me. Then Baptiste left Dayazell to focus on another project. I began to play with them within Dayazell, and the feeling was good!\nIsao : It was the end of the year 2009. We've been playing together since then.\n\nA strong feeling of unity and complicity radiates when you're on stage?\nYann : Yeah, we are really lucky we found each other. We have the same expectations, the same desire to seek for a better sound, always. And we do listen to each other a lot. We come frome different musical backgrounds, but, in the end, it creates unity and balance.\nGuilhem : The idea of energy is something that does make sense for us, rather we are rehearsaling, recording, or performing. The energies that circulate within us, and with the audience are essential data in the equation, but it happens naturally, we do not try to identify or rationalize it.\nNnay : We've been playing together a lot. So now, when we're on stage, we feel \"like home\"..\nGuilhem : ..and also we are good friends, in \"real\" life! I think that helps the music a lot.\n\nYou also work with a theatre company called \"Armutan\" Can you tell us more about this project?\nIsao : It's a company that works on historical themes. It gathers comedians, musicians, sword fighters, jugglers, dancers..\nYann : ..and one of those themes is \"Al Andalus\", the medieval Arabic Spain. We participate to this show as musicians.\nNnay : It's a lot different from the usual gigs, but we love it : we wear medieval costumes, and play underneath this really big berber tent. The audience seats on carpets and pillows. The proximity with the audience creates interesting dynamics.\nGuilhem : Indeed, the collaboration with Armutan leads us to play in different kinds of places : in the street, under a tent, in castles and churches. The great part is that, in those festivals, we reach a much larger audience, a more popular audience : people who would never come to a World music festival or an ancient music festival and they love it!\n\nTo conclude would you tell us a few words about your projects?\nNnay : We've been working lately on 6 or 7 new songs. We try to find new colors, while keeping the existing spirit.\nIsao : We want to \"visit\" new areas, to push the frontiers a little bit farther.\nYann : We've ben talking a lot about a side project, with some electro music..\nGuilhem : ..but it's top secret ! For now we're focusing on the next tour, we have some really nice concerts coming!",

    "bio": "Which is first - breadth of repertoire or musicianship? No matter. The sum total will titilate even the most jaded audience. Diana is an astounding harpist - playing pieces that range from inspired traditional-based tunes to improvisational skin-prickling scats. Consider it a blessed time, to have this music seep into your being.\"\n- Anne Emerick, Wisteria Ways concert series, January 2009\n\nHarpist Diana Rowan's playing has been described as having \"unusual power and beauty.\" Born in Ireland, she lived and studied on the East Coast, in Europe and the Middle East before settling in Berkeley, California. Each place profoundly influenced her music, which weaves Western classical sensibilities with Balkan, Sephardic and Middle Eastern inspiration, emphasizing both the primal and ethereal aspects of the harp, ancient and modern.\n\nWhile traveling the world influenced Diana's music, the people around her had an even stronger impact:\n\n\"Everything aligned,\" says Diana Rowan, speaking of the pivotal concert where she first heard historical harp and saw some of the people who would be important in her music life later on. A friend [Anna Kallis, high school friend from the Cyprus years, designer of all Diana's graphic art] had persuaded her to go to a performance of San Francisco Bay Area favorites Kitka and the Ensemble Alcatraz. It was a meditation concert, with no applause. The musicians sat in the center of a circle, with the audience surrounding them. The whole experience was a revelation for classically trained Diana. The Balkan music of Kitka, then directed by Bon Singer, brought nostalgia for Diana's youth, living in Cyprus and Iraq. Ensemble Alcatraz, with Shira Kammen on vielle, Peter Maund as percussionist, and Cheryl Ann Fulton playing her historical harp, captured Diana completely with their classical discipline yet playful spirit.\n- from the interview with Meghan Collins, Harpbeat Fall 2008\n\nLeaving her former life as a classical concert pianist, Diana studied with Cheryl and Maureen Brennan, and now collaborates frequently with Bon, Peter, and Shira, as well as beloved newer acquaintances:\n\n\"I believe music is the creation of much more than the actual performer. All people who have come before, the 'muse' or collective consciousness, the audience in its widest sense, all hugely affect the emerging piece of art. I think the time of lionizing the individual performer is waning, and the realization that we co-create art and life is dawning.\"\n\nPerforming worldwide (from the Australian Harp Festival to the Smithsonian to medieval Cypriot halls) and recording frequently, Diana can be heard on many CDs and soundtracks for film and TV, including her two solo albums Panta Rhei and The Bright Knowledge.\n\nwww.sirenharp.com\nwww.pantarheicd.com\nwww.thebrightknowledge.com\n\n\"Diana's shining soul and sparkling personality are conducted through her fingers through her harp to the very heart of any listener. She could take Happy Birthday and interpret in such a way that you'd laugh, cry and change your life.\"\n- Bon Singer, premier conductor of Balkan music in the US, founder of Kitka and Ya Elah\n\n\"Extremely beautiful playing...most gratifying...such fine musicianship\"\n- San Francisco Classical Voice\n\n\"Her harp is lyrical and ethereal, yes, but also uncommonly primal and percussive, rife with her signature follow-through, where even aural decay delivers deeply felt musical nuance.\"\n- Laura Glen Louis, author of \"Talking in the Dark\"\n\n\"You are truly a gift sent to me by the Harp Gods...you are the culmination of all my work, the highlight of my entire harp making career. There is no one I've ever heard that is so \"at one\" with the Nova harp, and takes it on journeys that can't even be imagined by others.\"\n- John Westling, master luthier and creator of Diana's harps",

For many years he has worked in radio, playing pop chart music and refining his technical skills.

There is a great deal of repetition, provided by arpeggiators and bass lines. Listen for synth effects and layered sounds. The music often builds to a crescendo several times throughout a song. Many tracks devolve into a spacey ambiance or floating piano-type lines at the end.\n\nThe \"Slower Emotions (138 BPM Remixes)\" album is a collection of remixes of songs from DJ Markitos' earlier albums, changed to be at a constant temp of 138 beats per minute. Originally, these songs were remixed for a company releasing the music as exercise-music, sold for Dance, Aerobics and other places where a constant tempo would be helpful. The music worked differently slowed down (most of the songs were originally faster) and it was thought that a release of the remixes might be interesting.",

The ensemble remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new.\n\nAs solo, chamber, and orchestral player, Schultz appears on nearly fifty recordings for such labels as Dorian, Naxos, Harmonia Mundi USA, New Albion, Amon Ra, and Koch International Classics. Schultz has produced and edited forty CDs for his colleagues and has also performed and recorded with world music groups such as D'CuCKOO and Haunted By Waters, using his electronically processed Baroque flute to develop alternative sounds that are unique to his instrument.

They have been receiving international acclaim for their exciting brand of Punk Rock and Roll, done with the great intensity of such bands as the Stooges, MC5, Dead Boys, NY Dolls, Damned, Black Flag, Misfits, AC/DC, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, etc. In addition to playing the most dynamic, ravenous, and menacing rock you've ever heard, EF recognizes the importance of integrity. From giving proper nods to the architects of street-level rock (Iggy and the Stooges, Dead Boys, AC/DC), to fiercely supporting DIY labels to their constant efforts to put fans first ahead of profit, EF is championing the cause to bring Rock back to the people and out of the hands of corporations. EF aren't young or pretty, and in case you haven't noticed neither is Real Rock & Roll. EF aren't here to be your girlfriend, they're here to ROCK! While stupid critics might say 'but, it's only rock n roll, its nothing new', EF fans are saying \"Damn, right!\" as they embrace the best of what's loud, fast, and rules from the last 30 years distilled down to one single organism. EF are one a mission to revitalize Rock & Roll and save people from the boredom of \"alternative music\". EF shows are intense, exciting, and inspiring.\n\nEF have been well reviewed in such magazines as Kerrang, Metal Hammer, Rock Sound, Alternative Press, Hit Parader, Seconds, Thrasher, Lollipop, Tail Spins, Rue Morgue, Maximum Rock N Roll, Flipside, Big Takeover, Paper, Aquarian Weekly, and countless European & Japanese magazines as well. NY Press picked EF as the \"Best Punk Band in NYC\". EF have received top 40 commercial radio airplay in the USA, Top 5-10 on many American college radio stations, and were Number One on Belgian, Finnish, and Swedish, etc., national radio. EF has even been picked by the Frankenstein Society as the bands representing the release of the Frankenstein commemorative stamp for the US Post Office. Not only are they one of the top most featured bands in the music press (currently #2 out of the Top 500!), but they have a loyal fan following in over 10 countries, with many bands citing EF as an influence and covering EF songs, and drawing thousands at music festivals internationally. EF's raw, powerful, and melodic Dead Boys meets AC/DC sound that has made them the Kings of High Energy Punk Rock N Roll!\n\nEF has been on over 40 of the world's best indie record labels (Sub Pop, Man's Ruin, Estrus, Get Hip, Victory, Au-go-go, TKO, Junk, etc.), selling hundreds of thousands of records. They have appeared on many European music televison shows and have had their songs or artwork featured in many videogames, movies and tv shows, including X-Files, Dawson's Creek, Signs, American Psycho 2, Flophouse, Tony Hawks Proskater, and the occasional porno flick as well. EF have since their inception been touring the US, UK, and Europe; often as headliner, even doing a sold out show at the Fillmore in SF and played to thousands at European festivals. EF played the 1997 Warp tour. They plan to tour Japan and Australia soon.

In 1992 she was invited to perform at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro and as a result of her performance encountered elders of a tribe called the Xavante, indigenous to the Mato Grosso. An intrepid traveller, and in accepting their invitation to visit a Xavante village she travelled alone off the beaten track and was guest with a chief and his family in a traditional Xavante dwelling. In 1995 as a result of this first visit she founded the registered charity \"Indigenous People's Cultural Support Trust\" no 1050461. Charitable donations and a match funding grant allocated by the British Government overseas development aid enabled her to work in collaboration with a Xavante chief and community and Emily over saw in Brazil the setting up of a solar powered health centre, medicinal gardens and funded a Xavante tribes man on a university course. When in town she was travelling around on $1.00 moped taxi service while she arranged contracts with local firms and then would take a five hour bus ride from the town to the Xavante reservation and stay in a palm hut.\n\nHer association with the Xavante was furthered due to their tradition of singing in groups and \"choirs\" and on the numerous occasions that she was staying with the tribe she was invited to record. She also made location recordings of their environment. These recordings and the experience of this time is shared through musical productions including her solo performance \"Into the Amazon\" which has a backing track featuring some of these recordings and is accompanied by seventy five projected images of daily life in a Xavante Indian village. The performance is particularly poignant in the light of global warming, climate change and the development of Brazil at the expense of the loss of a lot of their natural landscape. Where Emily stayed between '94 and '98 outside of the Xavante reservation is now a mono culture of soya for thousands of kilometres and the dawn chorus that Emily recorded has been massively diminished.",

There is no close second in influences because Sting is just my favorite. Always has been.\n\nBut my love for jazz greats- both performers and writers (Thelonious Monk, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Connick, Jr., George Gershwin, Cole Porter) definitely creates the tone of music. I also love wonderful and unusual songwriters: George Michael, Randy Newman, Paul Simon, Emily Loizeau, etc.\n\nIn a kind review of my most recent album, the writer says, \"Fun and sexy, Emma Wallace's catchy tunes will have you singing along with the refrain before you've even finished listening to them once. I love her intelligent humor and clever wording which make me listen carefully and then laugh out loud every time I hear her songs.

It was from here that she followed a not unpredictable but quite successful progression to the oboe, clarinet, and English and French horns. She studied (and is a great lover of) Romantic and Modern classical music, with a particular fondness for Debussy.\n\nPerhaps the most important twist in this so far dull history involves Emmalee's other fascination: electronics. Being adept at dismantling all manner of gadgets from an early age, she naturally developed a secondary musical affinity for analog synthesizers and other voltage-driven trinkets of noisemaking. She is now equally at home with a soldering iron as a woodwind, and is a great believer in circuit-bending*. Today, Emmalee blends woodwinds, horns and analog synthesizers with found sounds and bent circuits to create ambient, orchestral drone music reminiscent of Mark Hollis and Stars Of The Lid. Emmalee Crane was born in Toronto in 1983. She now lives in San Francisco with an unruly collection of instruments and her dog, Bash.\n\n* as long as you don't mention the time she totally wrecked a Juno 106\n\nFor more information visit her website.",

Sprinkled into these grooves are eclectic snippets of other genres, from synth-pop to industrial to loungecore to staright-up rock. Finally, bringing it all together is a female voice that is a blend of numerous eras, from the torch singers of the '40s to the classic female rockers to the modern trip-hop singers.\n\nEndless Blue, formed by vocalist Laura Hillman and producer Nick Mitchell in 2003, rose from the breakup of the Madison/Minneapolis electro-rock band STATE4. Leaving behind the frenetic, guitar-driven sound of their previous band, the duo quickly set off into the realm of dark downtempo. As the sound matured and the songwriting continued, Endless Blue added a second vocalist, jazzy crooner Amanda Oechsle. The trio recorded and released their self-titled debut, hitting the road for a short tour mid-2004.\n\nIn 2005, Mitchell and Hillman decided to relocate south to Milwaukee. Oechsle decided to leave Endless Blue and stay in Minneapolis, while the remaining members began work on their second release, Smoke Through It. The second Endless Blue album garnered significant college and public radio play, and the band toured regionally to support it. Mid-2006 found the band working on their next release and taking a break from live performance. The third release, Fever Dreams, was completed in late 2008 after a long three years of work and rework.",

By 14, his band got a gig opening for Richie Havens RIP, at the Cafe Wha in Greenwich Village in NYC. 'We were all so young, my mother had to drive us to the Club, with all of our equipment, wait and drive us home again'!\n\nEric's involvement with Rock continued throughout High School, College ... and beyond. After graduation from College, Eric took a year-long tour of Europe, which from a musical perspective, was certainly an eye-opener! Realizing that young kids of his own generation playing Rembetika in clubs in the Plaka in Athens or Flamenco in Spain - who were every bit as soulful as Jimi Hendrix made a deep and lasting impression!\n\nWell, so did the early Hip Hop artists and producers of the 80s and 90s! 'Babyface is still my hero! No matter who else comes along - the Neptunes or Kanye, as gifted as they admittedly are! ... Babyface was the first to create modern RnB as we know it IMHO'.\n\nCapitalizing on modern digital recording, Eric built his own digital home studio and started writing tracks and producing young RnB and Hip Hop artists ... for 15 years.\n\nIn a two-week break between producing engagements, largely out of boredom, Eric recorded a CD using his own instrumental tracks from his work as a producer, but using his Spanish guitar instead of singers or rappers. He (timidly) put the tracks on Myspace (in 2005 ... before Facebook) and was very surprised by the reaction. 'Within a few months, I had 500,000 Myspace fans. This was a bigger reaction than we got from any of our RnB or Hip Hop artists!'\n\nPutting 2-and-2 together, Eric understood that the global appeal of merging contemporary RnB beatz with more traditional 'old world' music held a lot of appeal on a global scale.\n\nSince then, Eric has created 2 more World Music fusion CDs and is just abut to launch a 4th this summer. 'All 3 albums are playing very actively on most Internet Radio stations and Social Media sites ... and selling quite well.'\n\nFor Eric, 'This is the beginning of a very exciting journey. That Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico are my three biggest countries, with my own country coming in at around 7 or 8 ... and ages 14-17 is my biggest fan base ... is positively weird!' ... but that is what the Internet is all about ... it's VERY democratic!\n\n'While I never in a million years intended this to be a political statement, one can't help notice that music from around the World, from the US, from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa can all work together so well cannot be overlooked! In the end, we are all the same!'\n\nYou can find out more about Eric on his website.",

    "bio": "Ernst Stolz is engaged in various aspects of music education. One of his major activities is the teaching of piano lessons at his music studio. Ernst is an experienced and much sought-after piano teacher, and has worked as a teacher of music in secondary education. He enjoys giving music lessons to both children and adults, and he considers these activities an important mission.\n\nErnst is a performer of early music (Renaissance and Baroque). He thinks it is of great importance that he is engaged himself, in making music at a high level. He primarily focuses on the viola da gamba, but also plays harpsichord. It is his conviction that there are always new things to learn in music and from the music itself. Ernst has received his training at several Dutch institutes of music, including The Royal Conservatory.\n\nHe studied recorder with Micheal Barker, harpsichord with Bob van Asperen, forte- piano with Stanley Hoogland and voice with Meinard Kraak. Ernst received his piano lessons from Sumiko Nagaoka at The Utrecht Conservatoire, where he graduated as a teacher/musician. In addition, he studied choir conducting in Tilburg with Louis Buskens, as well as music education in Rotterdam.\n\nApart from the many hours of teaching, he practices his various instruments on a daily basis. It is his conviction that there are always new things to learn in music. Other teachers include Bernard Kruijsen, Marjanne Blok, Jaques Ogg, Max van Egmond, Erik van Nevel and Rebecca Stewart. For some time, he also worked with viola da gamba players such as Wieland Kuijken, Freek Borstlap and Jose Vasquez. Frequently, Ernst participates in early music consorts and Cantata performances. His fine instruments have been built by Marco Ternovec and Floris van der Voort among others.\n\nThe playing of the viola da gamba, occupies a central place in his musical future. It is his intention to promote this wonderful instrument by public performance and the giving of private lessons. Ernst Stolz is available for basso continuo parts and playing Bach cantatas and the like. He performs frequently together with harpsichordist Karel Smagge.\n\nThe music recordings that he publishes on YouTube, amongst other things, have turned gradually into a substantial part of his music practice. In these video clips, Ernst performs various works from his vast repertoire in accordance with period performance practice. For many years, Ernst worked as a music teacher for Stichting Buitenkunst. Apart from the teaching activities at his own music studio, Ernst is also frequently occupied as a choral conductor.\n\nHis daily uploads on YouTube, have become an important part of his work. Many positive reactions are the result of this effort and moreover he got also attention from composers, colleagues, concert-organizations and even his music is used in an Italian film by Serena Nono (daughter of Luigi Nono).\n\nErnst is planning some recordings with other musicians for the coming years and some solo work like the works by Tobias Hume. Ernst Stolz is also a performer of Medieval music and his publishing plans are also in this field.\n\nIn Ernst's second release with Magnatune he works with Romeo Ciuffa and Karel Smagge on the release Ciaconna.\n\nRomeo Ciuffa approached music for the first time when he was eight through a local band experience, when he took his first flugelhorn classes. In 1989 he joined a French horn class at the Conservatoire of \"S. Cecilia\" in Rome, where his supervisor was Luciano Giuliani. Consequently he studied bass tuba and trombone at the same Conservatoire.\n\nHis concert activity and personal insight into the historical aspects of music allowed him to study different styles, starting from traditional chamber and solo repertoire until ancient music specifically related to the XVII and XVIII centuries. Mr. Ciuffa has been deeply touched and impressed by this kind of music.\n\nKarel Smagge was born in 1948 and studied harpsichord at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, Netherlands with Bob van Asperen. He also studied with Frans Bruggen, Don Smithers, Alan Curtis and Marius van Altena. As well as courses with Gustav Leonrd, Ton Koopman and Nikolaus Harnoncourt.\n\nHe is conductor of several choirs and also worked as the conductor or harpsichordist with the Monteverdi Ensemble (Gelsenkirchen), Pro Cantione Antiqua (London), Concerto Vivo (Dortmund), de Stadtische Oper (Dortmund), The Spirit of Gambo (NL), The King's College Choir (Cambridge) and Collegium Aureum (Koln) .\n\nKarel has also played on many early music festivals, in Radio broadcasts and was a lecturer for European universities.",

With drummer Zach Pliska joining the line-up, they set out to play the Detroit scenes. After certain modifications and a year of playing out, they decided to scrap the entirety of their songs and start over again.\n\nFUR defies the lo-fi, gloomy, washed out aesthetic of shoegaze rock and also the freaked-up-firestorm, trippy aesthetic of psychedelic. Pedal-wrung, winding guitar roars and big booming bass may be intrinsic to their dark, aggressive rock, but the group came from humble beginnings: basement writings between O'Rourke and O'Connor where \"we didn't even have amps; we had no idea about guitar toning or about pedals..\"\n\nThey'd met at Champagne family gatherings (as both dated respective sisters, Johanna and Jennifer) and wound up \"learning to play our instruments\" together, \"meeting at Radiohead,\" and enduring \"a series of craigslist misadventures (to find a drummer)\" as they pieced together what would become FUR, a propulsive, staticy-shadowed synth-dressed rock that culls melodic sensibilities from new-wave and post-punk but an edge a more metallic, industrial rock provocations.\n\n\"For some reason I was under the impression that Detroit was a very sort of blues-based, garage-rock, guitar-bass-drums kinda outlet,\" O'Rourke said. \"So, for the longest time I was avoiding making aggressive, darker music.\" Through high school and college, O'Rourke wrote/composed constantly, \"a lot of sounds and textures\" onto his computer. \"I listened to a lot of Nine Inch Nails and I think it was sort of returning to that influence and finally coming to terms with it as what I do, and what I like, it was not being afraid..\"\n\nWith Champagne on synth, O'Connor said, \"it gives us a different feel. You have this darker, more cluttered sound then you've got this nice, clean synth on top of it.\" The synth is key to FUR's enduring melodic sense, conjuring \"those great 80's groups.\" O'Connor and O'Rourke talk about their earlier musical discussions, which Cure album's better, Disintegration or Pornography, or the charm of Modern English records, the elegance of, yes, even the Carpenter's John Denver even.\n\nYou can find out more about FUR on their website and MySpace pages.",

Sara Stowe and Wendy Hancock had already met when recording Renaissance music together in Oxford for The Gift of Music label back in 2002. Ian Gammie then joined on viola da gamba, and brought with him a huge interest in and knowledge of Spanish and South-American music in particular. Studying Spanish and French at university, and having a family connection also helped. All three players had previously worked together on various occasions. The latest to join was Richard MacKenzie, recommended by the eminent lutenist Lynda Sayce, for his outstanding ability on early plucked instruments.\n\nSara Stowe - Soprano, percussion\nOne of Britain most versatile performers, Sara first studied piano and harpsichord at the Royal College of Music where she won a scholarship, the continuo and the Raymond Russell harpsichord prizes. A British Council award and vocal studies in Italy followed and she met and worked with Luciano Berio.\n\nHer ability to characterise her voice in so many different styles has led her to perform and record with a wide range of new and early music groups including: Matthew Spring (broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 , Classic FM and recording on Chandos), The Academy of Ancient Music (Decca), New London Consort (Decca), the Broadside Band, Sinfonye, James Wood (Continuum), Gemini and Singcircle. She has also featured twice on BBC Radio 4© Woman Hour. www.oxfordimedia.com/sara.html\n\nWendy Hancock - Recorders, flute and viols\n\nWendy is a music graduate of Exeter University. After gaining an MA in the Interpretation and Editing of Renaissance and Baroque Music at Nottingham University, she continued her research into 17th-century English music for an M.Phil, entitled 'The Origins of Basso Continuo in England 1585-1625'.\n\nShe has studied the baroque recorder with Michel Piguet and the baroque flute with Lisa Beznosiuk and Rachel Brown. For ten years she was editor of Chelys, the journal of the Viola da Gamba Society, and is still very interested in the viols and their music. In Nottingham she founded the Holme Pierrepont Opera Trust for the performance of Baroque opera on period instruments, and in 1985 founded Musica Donum Dei. Wendy has revised the entries pre-1700 of the Penguin Dictionary of Music, and written extensively for Encarta on musical subjects. She now performs, teaches, writes, reviews and edits and also teaches part-time for Nottingham University. Her musical interests are wide-ranging, but she is particularly interested in 17th and 18th century performance-practice and placing works in an (entertaining!) historical context. Her interests apart from music include mythology, history, the visual arts, literature and cookery and she is currently teaching courses on performance-practice and Handel. www.philidors.co.uk.\n\nIan Gammie - Viola da gamba\n\nIan Gammie is known primarily as a viola da gamba specialist, having for many years been a driving force in the English Consort of Viols.\n\nHis first love, however, was the guitar and he is an expert performer on a wide variety of early plucked instruments. He is also an authority on the Irish poet/balladeer Thomas Moore. www.boxandfir.com/PAGES/performers/gammie.htm.\n\nRichard MacKenzie - Theorbo, Baroque guitar, Renaissance lute\n\nLutenist Richard MacKenzie is rapidly gaining recognition as a soloist and collaborative artist on Renaissance and Baroque lutes, Renaissance and Baroque guitars, vihuela, orpharion and theorbo.\n\nIn 2011 Richard completed a degree in music at The Queen's College, University of Oxford. Whilst studying at the university he was also a keen solo performer, performing seven solo recitals in some of the most diverse concert venues across Oxford. Presently he continues to occasionally study lute with the internationally renowned lutenists Jakob Lindberg and Jacob Heringman, having previously studied at Chetham's School of Music with Hugh Cherry and Martin Shepherd, a school where has was awarded three prizes, including those for 'Early Music' and for 'Academic Music'. In 2012 the Lute Society of Great Britain published his first edition, a critical edition and reconstruction of the ensemble works from Giovanni Battista Granata's Armoniosi Toni (Bologna, 1684). Richard also possesses diplomas in recorder and clarinet performance, and was principal clarinettist for the National Children's Orchestra in his youth.\n\nRichard is an experienced recorder, guitar, piano and academic music tutor, tutoring up to A-Level, and also tutoring ABRSM theory grades. He has taught lute seminars and masterclasses involving members of the student community both at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music & Dance and the University of Chichester. Richard also has conducting and piano accompanimental experience, once directing a staged performance of Handel's 'The Choice of Hercules'. www.richardmackenzie.site50.net/1_4_About.html.",

At school in Lebanon, Satamian excelled in literature and languages, and for many years immersed himself in the French writers and poets. His early years were filled with the musical traditions of many cultures and styles: Armenian, Arabic, and Western, such as Romanticism and Impressionism.\n\nIn 1977, during the Civil War in Lebanon, Satamian moved to Armenian to continue his piano studies at the Gomitas Conservatory of Music in Yerevan. There he was exposed to the Armenian and Russian composers. He also pursued his love for singing through vocal coaching, finding voice and most natural and expressive instrument. He received his Masters degree in piano, in 1982, but vocal music had found a special place in his heart.\n\nIn 1983, Satamian left Lebanon with his family for Los Angeles. Deeply affected by the tragedies of the war in Lebanon he turned to the Scriptures for answers. For the next 10 years he taught piano while concentrating most of his energy on his spirituality.\n\nAlthough Satamian never studied composition formerly, he always knew he had a gift for writing melodies.

    "bio": "05 thru 06\nGhost of Maine started in 2005 with a group of friends in Muncie, Ind. that had been playing in and out of bands together since 1999. This lineup included drummer, Adam Wilson. Quickly gaining a strong fan base in central Indiana, the band self released their first EP, \"My Girlfriend Sleeps Four Feet Above the Sheets.\" In 2006, Ghost of Maine signed with local indie label Measure 4 Measure Records and began recording their second EP, \"Shark Tales\".\n\n2007\nMeasure 4 Measure absolved and although finished, the abum was not released. Determined to broaden their horizons with or without label backing, the band headed out for a two week stint, playing in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, South Carolina and Kentucky. In the Fall, Jesse Boggess stepped in on second guitar and the shred extravaganza was taken up another level.\n\n2008\nTaking the time to reconstruct goals, work in new members and work on writing, Ghost of Maine began the year on hiatus. After a couple months the band picked up where they left off, on the road as weekend warriors. They continued rocking the Midwest, adding Illinois and Wisconsin to the list, and released their self-titled EP. In August, Ghost of Maine was voted \"best unsigned metal band\" in a survey on Myspace Music and was the featured Metal artist on the site's main page. A couple of months later, the band put music up for purchase on iTunes, Amazon and Rhapsody.\n\n2009\nWithout skipping a beat, Ghost of Maine started 2009 with a few lineup changes. James Roberts took the reigns as frontman. Personalities, musical playing and writing styles instantly clicked and the band quickly wrote and recorded two tracks in Cleveland, Ohio for their upcoming album, \"Persistence of Vision.\" Since their formation, Ghost of Maine has played more than 250 shows in nine states, allowing them to be a self sufficient band for nearly 5 years. With little outside help, Ghost of Maine has managed to pay for t-shirt and CD printing, recording, travel and tour expenses, including the purchase and upkeep of the band van, Mary Jane.\n\n   Photos credit: Luke Ryan Photography\n   \n2010\n   Ghost of Maine began the new decade with another move to progress the musicianship and overall sound. New guitarist Jesse Curtis stepped in just in time to help record the band's fourth EP, Persistence of Vision. After recording, he teamed up with Jesse Boggess and both moved to seven string guitars to help continue the growth of this Midwest metal band and take Ghost of Maine song writing to new heights. The band quickly wrote and recorded, Rendition, a promotional bonus track for the EP that foreshadows the progressive tone and musicianship to come in the near future.\n   \nIn mid 2010 Andrew Wellman came to join as the bands most seasoned bassist to date. Gearing up to release an EP, Ghost of Maine accepted an offer from Magnatune (a fore runner in the music business to offer easy sales and licensing of music) to help sell and promote Persistence of Vision. Never losing momentum, the band finds themselves today completely in sync, pushing limits and each other, looking toward a promising future.\n   \n\n   \n\"Ghost of Maine is one of the few silver linings to the cloud that is metal music. Their music proves that this world still needs a headbangers ball (let alone an MTV) because this is the kind of stuff that made metal relevant again. Like something straight of a horror movie soundtrack, their music is aggressive enough to set the mood for bloodshed, yet articulate enough to gain a strong and appreciative following. There's just enough hook and melody to sweeten their sound for rock fans, the right touch of technique for progressive fans, and all the balls anyone could ask for to get their metal on. With two consitstently strong EP's to date, Ghost of Maine is destined to join the ranks of metal's finest.\"\n   Ian Shannon - SecondSetOfEars.com.\n   \nFor more on Ghost of Maine, please go to their MySpace page.",

    "bio": "I was born to loving but rather unmusical parents. My father's singing repertoire was limited to \"The Old Gray Mare\" performed with a toneless and impish gusto which I only heard two or three times that I can recall. My mother tells me she used to be able to pick out tunes on the piano one-handed. As a high school senior I bought my first album: \"Al Hirt Plays the Theme from The Green Hornet.\" I plead humble beginnings.\n\nMy freshman year at college I received an all-important Christmas gift: a $13.95 guitar from JC Penneys. This may sound like the apocrypha of a slightly disoriented blues musician, but I have friends who will swear to the truth of it. And like all new and dedicated players, I played it until my fingers were ragged and sore if not actually bleeding.\n\nUnder the influence of the devil instrument my musical tastes expanded beyond the themes of television shows. At first, I learned to play the music of Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, and then as my skill increased, Leo Kottke and Ton Van Bergeyk. Even from the beginning though I wrote my own tunes-albeit in the styles of others. Over several decades I listened to classical, jazz-fusion, pop-rock, and many other kinds of music which had nothing to do with guitars.\n\nAfter trying my hand at many different careers including store clerk, chemical technician at a steel mill, raw materials sampler, custodian, musical instruments sales- and repair-person, house husband, art gallery director, artist-in-residence, semi-pro musician and T'ai Chi instructor, I settled on elementary school teacher. Part of my training as a teacher included a class on educational technology. Technology and learning quickly became my area of expertise, and today I am Educational Technologist (a noble-sounding title for a catch-all plate of responsibilities) in the Molalla River School District in Oregon. I also write monthly technology and education columns for several different teacher publications. In the mid-90's, I discovered digital sound design. My music world went sploosh. And maybe squish, too. Brace yourself, brothers and sisters. I gave up fingerpicking.",

The ensemble is named after Francois LaRiche, one of the first great oboists, and a Zelig-like character. He influenced the writing of Purcell, Handel, Telemann, Bach, and Vivaldi, and was a bit of a Johnny Appleseed for the oboe. LaRiche & Co. is committed to reviving and preserving the legacy of the oboe's 18th Century Golden Age. The San Francisco Classical Voice raved about LaRiche's debut: \"...a spellbinding program. Though the members of LaRiche shone individually, it was their ensemble playing that made the afternoon truly remarkable\".\n\nGonzalo Xavier Ruiz has appeared both as principal oboist and concerto soloist with most of the leading period instrument groups in America and has performed widely in the U.S. and Europe under conductors such as Christopher Hogwood, Nicholas McGegan, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhardt, Reinhard Goebbel and Mark Minkowski. His playing is featured on numerous recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral repertoire. Equally accomplished on the modern instrument, he has performed as principal oboist of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, New Century Chamber Orchestra and the Pacific Chamber Symphony among others. Mr. Ruiz was a prizewinner at the Brugges Early Music Competition in Belgium and for many years has been professor of oboe at the Oberlin Conservatory's Baroque Performance Institute. He has also taught at the Longy School in Cambridge and given master classes at Indiana University. An active chamber musician, he has made numerous reconstructions and arrangements, notably from the works of Bach and Rameau. Twice he's been a featured recitalist at the annual convention of the International Double Reed Society. Mr. Ruiz is an acknowledged expert in historical reedmaking techniques, and over two dozen of his pieces are on permanent display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With his ensemble American Baroque Mr. Ruiz is also active in the field of contemporary music and was awarded the 2000 ASCAP Award for Adventurous Programming. Ruiz also performs with American Baroque.\n\nBaroque cellist Joanna Blendulf, a native of Sweden, has diverse musical interests, performing in chamber ensembles and orchestras throughout the United States. She received her musical training at the Cleveland Institute of Music and Indiana University, where she studied with Stanley Ritchie, Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi and Alan Harris. In 1998, Joanna received the prestigious Performer's Certificate from the Indiana University faculty for her achievements on baroque cello. Spending much of her time in transit, she is currently performing with the Portland Baroque Orchestra, American Bach Soloists, the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, Jubilate Baroque Orchestra, the Nashville Chamber Orchestra and the San Francisco Bach Choir. Joanna is an active chamber musician, touring with Mirable, American Baroque, Bimbetta, Musica Pacifica and The Streicher Trio, all based in the San Francisco Bay Area where she resides. She was named runner-up in the 2000 EMA/Dorian Competition for her recording of the Jean Zewalt Triemer cello sonatas and has recorded on the Dorian and Eclectra labels.\n\nKatherine Shao, harpsichordist and writer/composer, has performed with many of California' finest classical ensembles, including the New Century Chamber Orchestra, Magnificat, and the San Francisco Symphony.

    "description": "lend your heart to the dilruba",
    "bio": "Gopal's fondest childhood memories are all about music. His father played clarinet and mandolin, and used to play music for Gopal, even at night, when his little boy was in bed and falling asleep.\n\nMaybe that's why Gopal had a natural urge to play music as a child. As a small boy, his greatest wish was that his hands would grow bigger quickly, so that he could learn to play the guitar!\n\nSensing this longing to play music, his father gave him a small ukulele. After that, he and his father played music together whenever they could, right up to the time of his father's death. As if completing a circle, Gopal played his father's favorite classical guitar pieces as his father passed away.\n\nThis heart-to-heart musical connection with his father had a great influence on Gopal's life and became a foundation for his creative musical expression.\n\nDrawn to the East\nGopal was born in Canada and received his university education there. He was about to enter a postgraduate program and take a teaching post offered by the university, when he felt a mysterious calling to go to India. He had heard about a meditation master there and felt a longing to explore an unknown path.\n\nOne morning, as he awoke, Gopal knew in his heart that he was going to India - something from his own depth was calling him.\n\n\"Venu Gopal\" is the Indian name he received after meeting Osho, his meditation master. This new name marked the beginning of an inner journey. Living in Osho's community with other meditators, Gopal moved deeper into meditation and music, discovering how they meet and merge together.\n\nMeeting the Dilruba\nIn India, Gopal discovered and explored many unusual musical instruments and sounds. He was especially attracted to a string instrument called the \"dilruba\" (pronounced \"dill-rooba\").\n\nThe name of the instrument, its shape and sound are all reflected in the beautiful meaning of the word dilruba. It means \"beloved of the heart\", \"voice of the heart\" or \"thief of the heart\". It has many resonating strings that vibrate in synchronicity with bowed strings, giving a rich, reverberating and sweet sound.\n\nGopal fell in love with the dilruba from the first moment he heard it. It was truly the thief of his heart.\n\nFinding a Music Teacher\nSeveral Indian musicians told Gopal that the dilruba was \"out of fashion\" and was just a museum piece, rarely played anymore. Nevertheless he acquired his first dilruba and began searching for a teacher who could guide him.\n\nHe met a retired musician, but the man was reluctant to do any more teaching and, as a further obstacle, knew very little English. But Gopal had set his heart on playing the dilruba and kept knocking on the teacher's door. Finally, the man agreed to teach Gopal some basic steps and they developed a special, heart-to-heart relationship, with few words but full of music.\n\nGopal has fond memories of that time: listening to the old teacher play would sometimes bring tears to his eyes. This meeting of music and the heart enriched his life and took him deeper and deeper into the mysterious world of the dilruba.\n\nDeveloping His Own Style\nGopal often played the dilruba outdoors, during warm Indian evenings. Friends and strangers, just passing by, would spontaneously stop, sit and listen, as if captured by a few simple notes. He began to understand the sweet and gentle power of this instrument and it became a way of meeting friends, communicating in a deeper way than words can ever express.\n\nGopal plays the instrument differently than in the traditional way. He discovered that the dilruba has a wide range of \"colors\", from deep rich tones to high sweet sounds, from playfulness to heartfelt emotions. For some, its tender yet powerful sounds seem to come from an ancient time, evoking a feeling of \"coming back home.\"\n\nMeditation with the Dilruba\nThrough meditation, Gopal came to understand that the silent gaps between musical notes are significant: they can be a doorway to go beyond the busy mind. Music that gives space for silence can allow the listener to enter an inner, soundless place of peacefulness. This quality of music is expressed in his album \"Depth of My Heart: Solo Dilruba\".\n\nBesides its meditative quality, the dilruba also has a heartful sound that goes well with other instruments, creating a rich tapestry of sounds that touches the heart and relaxes the body-mind. This can be heard in \"Mystic Journey,\" an album that features the dilruba combined with other instruments.\n\nGopal's music is especially suited for soft movement, yoga, massage, healing, meditation, trance, relaxation and also for listening while falling asleep. His music has a natural inward quality, taking the listener from sounds to the soundless, from the busy market place to an inner silence that rests within everyone.\n\nTeaching and Courses\nGopal has combined eastern meditation with his western education in counseling, psychology and hypnosis. He offers worldwide courses in meditation, counseling, self-hypnosis and stress reduction.\n\nWhile teaching, Gopal creates a relaxing and playful atmosphere, through which people can go deeper within themselves. Child-like qualities such as innocence and essence are easily reawakened.\n\nBesides teaching, Gopal occasionally gives dilruba lessons and enjoys helping friends to find their own instrument - an old, beautiful and beloved dilruba.\n\nThe Tale of a Seeker\nThe following story is about a young man's search. It is also Gopal's story.\n\nA young man grew up in a western middle-class family with loving parents and siblings. Growing up, he became a teacher and was about to begin studying for a doctorate degree. He had everything a person of his age might want: a loving family, a bright future... life was generous to him.\n\nThe young man felt a joy of living, a sense of fullness in life, yet at the same time he was also wondering, \"What is this life really about? Is there anything more to it?\" With the awakening of this divine discontent, he felt pulled to go on a journey to India to meet a mystic, a meditation master, Osho. The journey changed his life forever. It opened many new doors for him. He loved India, the vibration of it... it was a feeling of divine synchronicity, of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nThe young man felt showered by the love and wisdom of his master, and realized that an inward journey had begun. His question, that there must be more to life, had been answered with a resounding \"Yes!\" He was relieved to know he was moving in the right direction, even if the destination was unknown. The master helped the young man go deeper and deeper into meditation. Even the master's death showed him that something within each human being is deathless; that life is a mysterious journey of awakening, and that love is beyond time and space.\n\nOne evening, the young man was sitting near a small river in India as the sun was setting. It was then that his heart heard the beautiful sound of music, coming from someone playing an unknown Indian musical instrument. He felt pulled to follow those sounds and sat nearby, as if in a trance. Those magical sounds would always be remembered, as they touched his inner spirit in the same way that his meditation master had touched his heart. From that moment, the dilruba became a meditation for him: learning, playing, listening, becoming one with it. It was a medium of expression that conveyed something beyond words: now he understood that music and meditation can dance hand in hand.\n\nAfter many years, this man continues to teach and play music, with joy and silence. Life flows on... and the mystic journey continues... with love and gratefulness.\n\nFor more information please email:\ncontactgopalmusic@gmail.com",

From there he went to Hollywood to pursue a life as bassist and cellist, performing and recording first with local underground bands and later with popular artists (Robbie Robertson, Sparks, Toni Childs, Gene Clark and others). Picking up clues from recognized producers T-Bone Burnett, Chad Blake, Daniel Lanois, Mitchel Froom (all of whom he met during sessions) and others, Hans developed a foundation for his work as a composer, producer and engineer.\n\nHis first instrument being the cello, Hans' musicality evolved around Western classical music. Technique and discipline were the building blocks for his musical education, although these were quickly augmented with his choice of the bass guitar as a second instrument (and leading to the subsequent immersion in rock music). The foundation for a rich musical career was thus prepared. His interest in World Music, especially from India, led him to pick up the Indian sarangi and sitara (a small customized sitar) and the Scandinavian nyckelharpa. Hans has played on countless albums, given hundreds of concerts, and produced many projects, including his collaborations with Kim Waters under the name RASA (visit rasa-music.com for lots of information) and several recent solo recordings.\n\nRecent solo projects include new instrumental releases called Undefended Heart, Sancta Camisia and Cinema Of Dreams. His work as a producer and mix engineer keep him busy with ongoing projects throughout the country, ranging stylistically from classical and folk to electronic and Indian devotional music. His most recent projects include several CDs with Sikh artists (Gurunam Singh, Nirinjan Kaur Khalsa, Simrit Kaur).

Over the last 10 years, Harry Manx released 11 Albums and has garnered seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist and won CBC Radio's Great Canadian Blues Award in 2007.

My mother fueled the constant creativity. She's a pianist, artist, and actress, currently painting murals in a small town in Mississippi, along with calligraphy and sculpting. My older sister was also very artistic, doing sign painting, piano, violin, and sparked my interest in music. I started playing guitar at age 16.\n\nRoad life\n\nAbout half way through college I got an offer to play with a band touring the east coast. I was the youngest member of a pretty bad bunch of guys who grew me up really fast. While the rest of the group were busy with nefarious activities, I used (most of) the time rehearsing. My rehearsal ritual started at sound check at the club, after lunch at the hotel, before the show at the club again, during the breaks between sets, then a couple of hours after the show. I was determined to be the next guitar great, concentrating mostly on soloing. Writing our own music wasn't even a consideration. I came off the road and made a move to Nashville with my brother who's a tremendous drummer, drum writer, and also a singer. He really could change my songs into something different, always improving the idea. We moved to Los Angeles to form a very different musical sound. We really made a great song writing team.\n\nClassical music\n\nAt this time, I really started picking apart classical music and trying to figure out what made the composers tick. Mozart's Requiem really had an impact on me - I listened to it every day for at least a year - I started picking apart the violin parts and realizing how amateur the rock musicians were compared to the great classical writers of the past. Each classical piece had more notes in it than a whole rock album and was much better written. I stopped worrying about the basic arrangements of modern music and started pulling ideas from Brahms and Bach. I had found something wonderful.\n\nArtwork\n\nFrustrated with having to depend on other musicians, I left for Louisiana at age 30 to pursue my paintings. One of the newest pieces is the cover of \"The Glass Desert\" CD. I don't really have the time to paint now because the music ideas are flowing. I do have sketches and ideas for future paintings but I'll need to have more of my time freed up before I can tackle another one - I put so much effort into a painting, I get to the point where I don't know whether I like it anymore or not. The image is seared into my mind where I know every detail of it before I look at it - I've had a few times when I really thought I was going a little nuts, putting a little too much pressure on myself to get the desired result.\n\nNew music\n\nThe newest music is so much fun for me. I used to have obstacles and now they're gone - in a band you always have to write around another instrument - now I just write and build on my ideas - I love it.\n\nFor more information about Harlan, please go to his website.",

    "bio": "The members of Harper's Hamper all met Celia while she was working as a harpsichordist and early harpist. Having researched and arranged lesser known carols from Baroque and Victorian times, she performed them together with some of her friends at Christmas and the idea of making a recording was born.\n\nCelia Harper worked for many years as a keyboard continuo player and latterly double harpist, playing and recording with most of Britain's early music ensembles in concert and opera. She was for many years particularly associated with Kent Opera's baroque productions under Sir Roger Norrington and has worked with conductors such as Harry Christophers (The Sixteen), Paul McCreesh (Gabrieli Consort and Players), Sir John Eliot Gardiner and Christopher Hogwood.\n\nShe has taught as a singer's style coach on early music at the Britten-Pears School in Aldeburgh and also with the European Union Baroque Orchestra. Her interest in researching 17th and 18th century music led to her devising several series of music programmes for S4C, the Welsh Television Channel and in \"All Hayle to the Days\", an album of carols from the 17th century to Victorian times.\n\nCelia started composing in 1994 and has had works premiered by Michael Chance and Fretwork, Robin Blaze, Dame Felicity Palmer, Canterbury Chamber Choir, Chiswick Baroque and the Joyful Company of Singers among others. Her ensemble Sulis has been involved in ground-breaking research into music and healing at Bristol Cancer Help Centre.\n\nIn 2007 Celia won prizes in the English Poetry and Song Society's song writing competition, and the ensuing song cycle \"Songs of Gloucestershire\" to poetry by FW Harvey was premiered by bass-baritone Michael George in 2008. In 2009-2010 Celia was Composer in Residence at Holy Innocents Church, Hammersmith and her commissioned Mass for Childermas Day was premiered in January 2010 and repeated in January 2011. Celia's 3 Sulis CDs are all available on Magnatune.\n\nEirian James was born in Wales and studied at the Royal College of Music with Ruth Packer. After studying she was soon in great demand and is now recognised as one of Britain's leading singers, with a flourishing operatic, concert and recording career.\n\nHer British appearances have seen her on the stages of all our leading opera companies. She has sung major roles with Covent Garden, English National Opera, Opera North, Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera and Kent Opera (which played a very important part in her early career and gave her many leading roles.) She has also performed for Sadlers Wells, Buxton Festival, the Singer's Company and the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nHer international career has taken her to many of the major opera houses of the world, including Netherlands Opera, Opera de Lyon, Geneva Opera, Munich and Dresden Opera and Houston Opera. Eirian has worked with eminent conductors including Sir Colin Davis, Jeffrey Tate, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Sir Roger Norrington, William Christie, and Mark Minkowski among others. She has also appeared on many recordings.\n\nThe concert platform continues to play an important part in Eirian James' work. She has been seen in the BBC Proms, at the Aldeburgh Festival, the Barbican and with the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. Some notable concerts have included Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen in Lyon, Beethoven's Mass in C in London with Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Mozart's C minor Mass in Edinburgh and Paris with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Haydn's Harmonienmesse with Sir Roger Norrington, Mendelssohn's Elijah with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Gluck's La Corona at the City of London Festival and concert performances of Cosi fan tutte with Sir Neville Marriner in Paris. With the Akademie fur Alte Musik she has performed Irene (Theodora), Cyrus (Belshazzar) and Queen of Sheba (Solomon) all three broadcast live on Radio.\n\nShe is no stranger to TV either, having hosted many music series on Channel Four Wales. Her most recent operatic appearances were Falsirena (La Catena d'Adone) an opera of Domenico Mazzocchi (17th century) in Innsbruck and Antwerp, and Zerlina at San Diego Opera.\n\nJulie Kennard read music at the University of Southampton and then went on to the Royal College of Music to study singing with Ruth Packer.\n\nJulie has always specialised in oratorio although early on in her career she took lead roles in several operas. She has appeared in all major UK concert halls and Cathedrals and in many venues abroad. In Ireland, she was a soloist in Mahler's Eighth Symphony for RTE Television and Bach's Mass in B Minor; in Italy, Poland, Switzerland and France she performed the role of Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas; in Iceland she featured as soprano soloist in John Speight's Symphony No. 2 for the Symposium of Nordic composers - a work she has subsequently recorded. Verdi's Requiem has also played a large part in Julie's career and to date she has sung 80 performances of that great work.\n\nEnglish music has featured strongly in her repertoire and she has sung numerous performances of Vaughan Williams' Sea Symphony, Elgar's The Kingdom and Apostles, Herbert Howells' Hymnus Paradisi and Britten's War Requiem. The War Requiem was highlighted in a television documentary of Britten and showed Julie singing in a commemorative performance from Coventry Cathedral with CUMS and Stephen Cleobury.\n\nSolo recitals in Luxemburg and at the Three Choirs Festival have featured Schumann's \"Frauenliebe und Leben\", \"Les Nuits d'ete,\" by Berlioz and \"On this Island\" by Britten, \"The Four Last Songs\" by Strauss and a recital for soprano and organ featuring a new commission by Pavel Novak - \"The lake of heavenly Desires\". She was the soprano soloist in a programme of words and music celebrating the life of Admiral Lord Nelson with Richard Baker as the narrator and also in a programme featuring Dame Judi Dench and her family.\n\nJulie's recordings show her versatility - they include Monteverdi's Christmas Vespers, Haydn's Nelson Mass with St. Paul's Cathedral and Howells' \"Hymnus Paradisi\" with Vernon Handley and the RLPO.\n\nJulie also enjoys teaching singing at the Royal Academy of Music and is the Artistic Director of the Grove Park Music Festival.

He subsequently studied in the Opera School at the Royal College of Music and made his debut in London in October 1967.\n\nFor the next ten years he sang and recorded with the Deller Consort, under the direction of Alfred Deller, whilst establishing himself as an opera singer. He was a principal tenor with Kent Opera for the entire twenty years of its existence. In the 1970s he was appointed as an RCM singing professor by Sir David Willcocks, for whom he became a regular soloist with the Bach Choir, especially in the Bach Passions.\n\nHe has carved out a unique career, being equally at home as an Operatic, Oratorio and Recital singer; and combining this with an increasingly important role as a musicologist. In 2003 he was appointed to a Cambridge Fellowship to enable him to write a book about Handel's favourite English tenor: John Beard. He has delivered scholarly papers to conferences on Handel and 18th century London Theatrical life.\n\nNeil has translated and edited all of Bach's major choral works for the New Novello Choral Edition, and Haydn's choral works for King's Music.

Heavy Mellow has released two albums, with more expected in the future. The first, Acoustic Abstracts is a collection of duets with a simple, refreshing feel. The second album Horizons follows in the same vein, but with more layers to yield a bit fuller sound including bass, percussion, and additional instruments on some tracks.\n\nHeavy Mellow is Barry Sulkin and Paul Hadley Davis. Sulkin (on left) plays finger-style guitars - six and twelve-string steel, classical, and dobro - in a variety of tunings, along with mandolin and harmonica. Davis plays lead guitar, mandolin, bass, and keys. They first met while attending the University of Virginia, then re-connected in Nashville, where they helped form the Americana band Back Creek.

Starting way back in the 90s, Andy was singer/guitarist with indie band 'Monkeyland' for about 6 years. The band spent time playing gigs alongside UK indie favourites of the time such as Shed Seven, The House of Love, The Railway Children and many others and received much radio airplay including Radio One.\n\nWhen Monkeyland dissolved, Andy spend a few years engaged in mix media projects and worked on video and animation productions with one of Manchester's baggy bands - Inspiral Carpets and various other bands on the Mute label, but quickly returned to joining another band - 'Cannula', this time just playing guitars and producing.\n\nIn 2002, Andy began to produce tracks, alone under the name 'Heifervescent' and the debut album Hoofed and Dangerous was a big step back to naivety and pop sensibility, but with few twists and turns. The album received an enormous amount of plays with the growth of internet radio stations and music sites.\n\n2003 brought the second album, Verbal Bandit, which was more folky, acoustic and raw. The difficult third album came in 2004 called Murder in the Garden which had more of a hard edge than previous albums.\n\nThe most successful and most listened to album came in 2005 and was called Pondlife Fiasco. As with all the Heifervescent albums, Pondlife Fiasco was released under a Creative Commons license and ensured that listeners could easily give the album a try. The album was one of the most listened to Creative Commons albums and continues to get many plays and downloads.\n\nThe Glue Factory album was put together a few years later from tracks that just didn't fit with any of the previous albums, and so is more of an eclectic mix.\n\nIn 2011, Andy re-recorded many of his early compositions from his days in 'Monkeyland' and released them in the shape of 'Further Adventures in Monkeyland'\n\nAs well as the Heifervescent works, Andy actively writes and records music for specific requirements - for film, video, motion graphics and advertising, recording all instruments and programming himself.

Commanding, yet sophisticated drums augment ethereal and sometimes scathing guitars.\n\nClean and other-worldly vocals top it off for an unusual counterpoint of haunting beauty and unforgiving aural assaults.\n\nBut HTM is not just about the music, it's about music with something worthwhile to say. Being a medium for growth and change is intrinsic to the music's purpose. The name \"Heir to Madness\" was not coined by accident. We are all heirs to the madness of this world. The madness that destroys the earth, kills millions, lets millions die, that separates, hordes, and gives rise to the ego.\n\nHTM's first release, The Citadel, is about that ego, the mind-construct, and all its intricacies. The ego is much like a citadel. It is the stronghold of our person, our idea of our self. It is to be defended at all costs. High walls and weapons-at-the-ready protect the fragile idea of our imagined importance and keeps us \"safe\". Yet that \"safety\" has an extremely high price. That price is your very self. When you enter the citadel you relinquish your freewill, to be subjugated to the holy ego forevermore. Some will pay homage to it, others will anger it. Either way, you will be at its every whim.\n\nThe ego has a peculiar way of clouding your perceptions. You'll see what it wants you to see. You'll hear what it wants you to hear. Revoking the ego's supremacy is the key to leaving this self-made fortress, and in doing so, we end the master/slave relationship and escape everything that society, parents, school systems, clergy, and government has drilled into us since birth. Freedom from the ego is freedom from every distorted idea you ever had about yourself. Without the ego, we have nothing to defend, and with nothing to defend, we have nothing to fear.",

Since then, writing and recording music has been a way for him to forget the various bad hairstyles he attempted throughout the 90's (for instance, the infamous bald guy with pony tail look). He's had the privilege of working many exciting shitty jobs. From office supplies replenisher to food delivery specialist, from wrangler of the mentally ill, to naked guy in plays, all his experiences have influenced the eclectic nature of his music.

Songs such as \"You Can't Stay at My Apartment\" which deals with the psycho uninvited house guest who never leaves and \"Therapy\" which tells the charming story of a crystal meth smoking ex-girlfriend are examples of Winzenried's lyrical style. The music itself is a synthesis of different genres including hip hop, pop, rock, glam, reggae, and alternative. However, they all share the same message: if you are able to laugh at the humorous fragile nature of life, you'll stop viewing yourself as a victim and take back the controls.\n\nAround L.A., this group of alcoholic misfits are also know as The Hollywood Drunks, especially since the name Winzenried is too hard to spell, pronounce, or even look at without becoming completely exhausted. In hindsight, they realize now that it was a bad name choice but alas they are stuck with it like an old cold sore that never leaves, thus, the entirely not subtle name change to Winzenried aka Hollywood Drunks.

    "bio": "Howard Ferre is an Ambient (Neo-classical/New Age) composer who has been creating original music, soundtracks and sound design for the theater, film and video for over 25 years and has been acclaimed by critics and audiences alike.\n\n\"It's a hard-to-pin-down disc that embraces spacey floats, so-cool jazz flavors and post-rock melodies with equal ease... This Journey's End is clearly just the beginning.\"\nHypnagogue\n\n\"For me the most poignant pieces are the wistful, meandering Wax Branches where beautifully fragile piano lines take the lead over airy synthetic washes and the equally reflective Reaching Out, where the electronic soundscaping is a little more prominent, suggestive of heavenly light and weightless reverie, once more with sensitive, melancholy piano phrases pulling at the heart.\"\nMorpheus Music's Blog\n\nHoward was always mesmerized by how music and sound brought so much emotion to a performance. His earliest inspiration came in the second grade, when he was introduced to the organ. As several of the sounds were being demonstrated by one of the teachers, he remembers marveling at how one person can perform and compose fully orchestrated sounds all by himself. Fascinated by this, he grew up with an extensive movie soundtrack collection and became influenced by Peter Gabriel, Arvo Part, Philip Glass, John Williams, Miles Davis and Pink Floyd. As the years went on, he accumulated a wide variety of synthesizers, samplers and recording equipment and now Howard brings the audience into the show with his ear for the truth in sound and his passion for the way it touches a listener with emotion.\n\nHoward continues composing music and Sound Design, through Ferrestudios, in the South Florida area for various productions and theatre groups. He is also working on a new album coming out soon and an original musical project to be announced in 2012.",

    "description": "gothic darkwave hard-edged rock",
    "bio": "Hybris was formed during a cold winter in the city of \"Kiel\", in Northern Germany in 1998. The local musician scene was mostly represented by heavy- and trash-metal bands, but gothic and other dark music styles are quite popular at several clubs and local events. 7 musicians had the dream of creating powerful melancholic music - representing the emotions of the local gothic rock community.\n\nGothic rock has as many facets as other music styles and a poll of 7 different musicians will have at least 14 opinions about the right way. The first try at Hybris ended without any success and only 2 half completed songs. The lack of success led to disharmony and the band came apart.\n\nThose members of the band, who had decided to not give up, were in a difficult spot. Gothic rock musicians are not as common as representives from other music styles and even in the coldness of Northern Germany there won't be so many guitarists with the \"right\" emotions. So they've decided to start an experiment. Instead of working with 7 musicians with very strong emotions about \"the right\" style of gothic music they opened the band for musicians with wider and different experience in different music styles - and due to that a more experimental approach to the right music style.\n\nOne of the new members was Janis Schibalski a former guitarist and songwriter of a glam rock/party-metal band. Despite his changed preferences (more serious, darker music instead of event driven music the differences between him and most of the other members could not be bigger. Hybris was never planned as a project of friends - it was planned as an experiment, a melting pot of emotions, ideas and extremely different individuals. It was a courageous plan with a strong dedication to at least local succes. This led to the band name: Hybris (which means Hubris in English).\n\nHelge Barth (Bass), Anne Kampmann (Backing Vocals) and Thyra Christmann (Keyboards) were the most \"classical\" gothic musicians, Malte Volquardsen (Drums) had several roots in Punk, Folk and other music styles. Bent Maczewski (guitar) was the bands representive of solid rock music, Gerret Goos (Lead Vocals) had several roots in gothic rock and metal and Janis Schibalski (guitars) with his long experience as live musician and songwriter completed the band.\n\nAn era of hot emotions started in the Hybris rehearsal room - conflicts, discussions but the strong will to achive results. Rotten Flowers was the first result of the melting pot process. Based on an old song of Janis, the band managed it to create a symbiosis out of everyone's influences and emotions. A real conjointly-created work and a sum that was more than its parts.\n\nStrife changed to euphoria and the band quickly recorded the song together with \"Final Trust\" to create a demo CD. Helge handed copies of the demo recording to local DJs of Gothic Clubs and Events and --very ungothic-like-- the members of Hybris nervously awaited the first reactions of the audience. The result was much better than expected. Rotten Flowers and also Final Trust were dancable (note: which means dancable for gothic-fans :P) the DJ urged to make clear, that this was really a demo recording of Hybris and some visitors of the event asked \"Which band was it? Never heard it before!\"\n\nMotivated by the first success, Hybris worked on additional material and completed the last song for the first live-gig only days before the event. The impressive Voice of Gerret and the multifaceted gothic-rock of Hybris lead to several gigs in northern Germany and the CD-Recording \"The First Words\" which marked the zenith of the band history.\n\nSuccess ushered strife.\n\nSome members of the band wanted bigger influence to the songwriting and the direction of the music, others wanted to invest more money for the \"Big deal\" and others wanted to concentrate on live events.\n\nAnother cold winter in Northern Germany, and the band fall apart. Flowers rot, Hybris died, but the music is still remembered - which describes the Album \"The First Words\" and the emotions in this music in a better way than long stories can tell.",

More than 20,000 EPs wound up in the possession of a devout fan base.\n\n\"When you ache like this does it make you wish My silent choir would sing to you?\" (\"My Silent Choir\")\n\nIn 2008, a 3-song EP recorded with the legendary platinum-encased Sylvia Massy (Tool, System Of A Down) brought their sound and passion to exponentially more listeners across the globe, resulting in ten placements in five episodes of Season 4 of MTV's \"Jersey Shore\", featured artist status and an exclusive artist profile at mtv.com and performances at Mayhem Festival and Ozzfest. Now, producer Seth von Paulus has taken the band to previously unrealized sonic heights with a new record which is already receiving commercial radio airplay, provided the soundtrack for Beachbody/P90X events in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and led to their selection as one of forty artists chosen to be featured as part of the relaunch of MySpace Music.

Beginning as a series of intimate, informal concerts in Bay Area homes, Hausmusik moved into the parish hall at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Albany, making it a real community concert series the first such series in the city of Albany, for which director Eileen Hadidian received the city's 1992 Citizen of the Year in the Arts award.\n\nOver the years, Hausmusik has helped support local musicians, particularly those interested in trying out new programs and exploring the crossover between early and ethnic music.

The pieces played had to be therefore, both technically challenging and harmonically and melodically pleasing. Much of the repertoire was born during band practices. Paolo would propose a drum beat, Ivano a bass riff and Ian would then go home to work on the ideas using Cubase as a music editor. The result was an explosive mixture of funky bass lines, progressive drum breaks and jazzy guitar melodies.\n\nA few years later Ivano opened up his own recording studio called Feedback Studio and Paolo decided to leave the band. He was substituted by Roberto Marziali on drums and Luca Benvenuto was asked to join in as the keyboard player. By the year 2003, Individual Choice had been gigging successfully for various years and with a recording studio at hand and Luca's expertise as a sound engineer as well as a musician, the time was now ripe to record an album.\n\nMake Your Choice is entirely self-produced with a lot of care and time used both in the recording and in the mixing. From the prog and heavy rock feel of Hole in the Stomach, to the spacey and relaxed 6/4 tempo of Timewarp, to the humorous and bouncy Packman, to the obsessive rhythm of Jungle Jazzin', to the jazz fusion experiments in Fusian, to the celtic sounds of Scott, to the funky bassline of Moving Head, this album is a unique blend of different styles, harmonies and rhythms.\n\nIvano, Luca, Roberto and Ian hope this can be your choice as well as ours.",

Inspired by vinyl records and electronic music Benny financed his first sampler and synthesizer sequencer, the Ensoniq ASR 10 and Ensoniq SD1-32 respectively.\n\nAt some point during Benny's Enron stay, long time friend Steven Tune joined forces and the two discovered a symbiotic respect for collecting vinyl records and music technology. Strong influences for the two at that time included bands like Meat Beat Manifesto and Orbital. In the midst of collecting dance music records, exploring sampler / sequencer technology and working dead-end day jobs, their appreciation of electronic music and the quest for quality of life eventually clashed with Corporate America. In September of 1993 the two walked out on corporate ideas and moved to San Francisco, California to pursue their music careers - with sampler, synthesizer and record crates in hand.\n\nSoon after arriving at San Francisco, a production team was defined by Benny and Steven called OUTRO. OUTRO's audio technique infused tight repetitive sequences with ambient melodies which resonated closely to their vinyl likes (Dead Can Dance, Meat Beat Manifesto, Ministry, Orbital, Baby Ford, Moby, Depeche Mode and Severed Heads). Then, in a synergistic chain of events, band mate Steven Tune crossed paths with Jim Siegal. Jim Siegel is a significant voice and spirit in the San Francisco music community. Because of OUTRO's respect for Jim's contributions to San Francisco society and Jim's insight and respect of OUTRO's music path, the trio laid a friendly foundation and began working together. Almost instantly OUTRO found what they were looking for and were catapulted into the SF Underground music scene. The duo then met Cabaret Voltaire and Cocteau Twins percussionist Dave \"Polf\" Palfreeman, and began to write songs together. The collaborative effort eventually produced a 3 song instrumental EP and to this day remains a pivotal and inspiring musical lesson and experience for life-long friends Benny and Steven.\n\nAfter a few years of continued production and success, Jim Siegel made further investments in the SF Underground by purchasing a Victorian home at 606 Haight Street. OUTRO were invited to move into the mansion, set up production and invite other artists and inspirations to live there as an artistic commune. The mansion as a whole became a forceful music movement by its multi-talented residents DJ Steven Tune, UFO, Abstract, Sage, Markus Miller and Gabe Real to name a few. Sometime during the mid to late 90's, with 606 in full throttle production, OUTRO disbanded (Benny began writing under the moniker iNTROSPEKT while Steven moved on to DJ production and hosting parties and large dance music events). Inspired by the sounds of his resident surroundings iNTROSPEKT journeyed deeper into Drum-N-Bass, House, Electro, Ambient and every flavor in between.\n\nEventually, somewhere during the OUTRO transition, iNTROSPEKT crossed paths with Serge Durand, a seasoned world musician from France. Benny was a fresh new member working at the famous Haight-Ashbury Music Center - just a short distance up the street from 606, when a used Roland Jupiter 8 synthesizer arrived at the store and was placed on sale. Benny eventually sold the synth and little did he know the sale was to pay the way for Serge to move to San Francisco. Upon arrival the two immediately sparked a friendship and joined musical forces to create TANKA Productions. Most of TANKA's early days were spent constructing operational facilities. After a few months, unforeseen events forced a move a few miles across town to 606 Haight Street where Nova Productions was established and a fully functional recording studio was birthed. During the months of sonic exploration and hard work, artist Christophe Royer, also a native of France entered the picture. The trio continued construction while producing House and World music but after it was all said and done the effort was to send Serge Durand into a new and inspiring career path. Serge decided to move on. Benny, continuing as iNTROSPEKT at the time, finished construction of the studio and delivered several years of quality compositions, cross producing with Christophe when the vibe was right. Eventually the two broke into film and television scoring a video game commercial and working with Sony, MTV, and MGM/360 Productions to name a few.\n\nBy the year 2000 iNTROSPEKT had moved on from Haight-Ashbury Music Center and was working for the now somewhat dissolved Digidesign Corporation, makers of Pro Tools. In the midst of starting a family and a new job in the music software industry, Benny crossed paths with a long time influence Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto. Out of shear inspiration, Benny then fostered an idea to remix Meat Beat Manifesto tracks. Having befriended \"The Zombie\" list and having met Francesca online, Benny recreated several remixes while Francesca spear headed the effort to share it with the world. Although the resulting product could not be licensed and released legally it did generate remixes from talents Basin Gently, Without Breathing, Eight Frozen Modules, Exillon, Adrian Cabassa, Willie Lister, Line Noise, Disco Room, Hexane, Ron West and Topher. The end result is a culmination of inspiration and talent that can be heard here.\n\niNTROSPEKT continued producing and crafting his sound while working for Digidesign, and eventually crossed paths with singer, songwriter and percussionist Jorge Bermudez of The Bermudez Triangle. Jorge, a native Nicarguan, sports a hugely dynamic and successful music track record that includes having played with bands Crowded House, Jeffrey Osborne, Mickey Hart and Pablo Cruise to name a few. Benny and Jorge's mutual respect for each others' talents catapulted the two straight into the studio where they began infusing heavily percussive layers with catchy melodies surrounded by the energy of a techno groove. After many hours and months of studio production the two quickly landed hits in film and with local major television networks. Now over 10 years in the making the duo continue to cross pollinate by writing new and original tunes as well as remixing and bringing old but not forgotten hits back to life. Their latest big success is a remix / remake of Malo's \"Suavecito\".\n\nIn 2001 Benny could feel the desire to expand his production outfit and plans were developed to move to Los Angeles. Before iNTROSPEKT took a step towards Southern California he was suddenly commissioned to create a remix of Depeche Mode's song \"I Feel Love\" off the bands new \"Exciter\" album. This was yet another milestone in Benny's career path that fulfilled a long time dream of his, to be a part of the Depeche Mode legacy. After completing the remix, more projects and inspiration kept Benny in the San Francisco area for a few more years, and that momentum eventually launched him towards Los Angeles with experience, credits and inspiration in tow.\n\nSoon after arriving in Los Angeles in 2005 Benny teamed up with Richard G. Jones, a prominent Dub Reggae DJ and musician from Miami, Florida. Together they quickly launched their record label New Blues Musik and developed a sound called Electro-Reggae-Blues under the moniker \"Version\". Production credits include the release of a full-length CD and a 12\" EP titled Gardens of Utopia - featuring the talents of Mikey Dread (The Clash), Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound and Stand-Out Selecta (Independent Distribution Collective - SF). New Blues Musik also provided production assistance and collaborated with talents Shaunna Hall of 4 Non-Blondes / George Clinton and P-Funk and House Music outfit Soul Planet. After a few US concerts, a tour of Europe and a brief but productive 2 years, VERSION pulled the plug on its operations and Benny was back in solo production mode, searching for a new path and new beginnings.\n\nFast forward to 2010 and Benny started a new project, called \"Cavalcade\" with a new sound and some insprirational remixes, by Meat Beat Manifesto, George Cochrane (Weatherhouse / Black Flamingo), Velapene Screen and LoFeye.",

    "bio": "Ion is a new solo venture by established UK musician, David J. Hughes. Most people will know David as the founder member of T-Bass and the last man standing in the SkinMechanix collaboration. Both of these ventures typify the Hughes approach to making music. In other words, foot-on-the-floor, pedal-to-the-metal, full-on electronic power tracks with only an occasional nod towards slower, more romantic moods and feelings.\n\nIon, however, represents a musical tanent for Hughes-a back-to-basics approach with an emphasis on a more symphonic, relaxed sound.\n\nSays David, \"The Ion project came about more or less by accident. In the midst of testing our recently developed ZEIT Step Sequencer, someone forgot to hit the stop button on the recorder and found that we had accidentally recorded more than 20 minutes of random, sequenced noodling, which had no real structure and no real direction. However, rather than just delete the session, we decided to listen ... and came away with the feeling that the music had a raw and unprocessed feel, it was completely natural, unforced and unhurried, the sound of a musician happy to do nothing more than aimlessly wander down strange and previously unexplored pathways.\"\n\nThe end result was the track The Silent Scream, which was editted down from 20 minutes of ambient indulgence to just 5 minutes of actual music. The chords and the lead lines came a few minutes later, composed on the fly and in one pass, with successful takes simply cut and pasted together to build up the layers.\n\n\"We were stunned by the realisation that it was possible to write something that was just about halfway decent in such a short space of time, the music of Ion grew out of this new-found fascination for tightly controlled rhythmic patterns coupled with the joy of re-discoevering the lost art of improvised electronic music.\"\n\nListen to the music of Ion and simply enjoy. Sequencer music doesn't get any better than this.",

(For example, he had invented the tape loop at 13, unaware that it had already been done). His first influences were Charlie Parker, Lee Konitz and Ornette Coleman.\n\nHis first break was playing a solo on a song by rock group Timpuri Noi. Then he played with other jazz and rock musicians and bands throughout the 90's, including pianist Harry Tavitian - with whom he recorded two albums, Axis Mundi and Balcaz - pianist Lucian Ban - before his departure for New York - guitarist Sorin Romanescu, bassist Vlaicu Golcea, trombonist Tom Smith and singer Marta Hristea, notably on the live album \"11\" by East Village Open Formula.\n\nSince 2003 he has been leading his own band, Iordache, initially inspired by the Sun Ra Arkestra. He also took \"Iordache\" as a stage name, to create confusion. The band has recorded three studio albums: Friday - featuring Tom Smith (2003), Dissipatin'(2005) and One Life Left (2012). The latest has been released by Iordache's own label, Fiver House Records.\n\nIordache has played in most Romanian clubs and festivals, notably at Stufstock, Jazz and More, Green Hours International Jazz Fest and Garana Jazz Fest, and in a few other countries, including Hungary (with guitarist Eichinger Tibor as a guest), Belgium (with Eugene Chadbourne), Luxembourg and Israel. In 2012 Iordache opened for the Jack DeJohnette Group at Sala Radio (Radio Hall) in Bucharest.\n\nIordache describes his music as free funk, where compositions and improvisations are governed by the rules of chance.\n\nThe current line-up includes Iordache on saxophones and flute, Sebastian Burneci on trumpet, trombonist Florian Radu, guitarist Dan Alex Mitrofan, keyboardist Toni Kuhn, bassist Utu Pascu and drummer Tavi Scurtu.\n\nIordache has also played saxophone, flute and tambourine with indie rock band Kumm, since 2003.",

Christopher plays guitar, Ztar, keyboards, synthesizers and devices.\n\nChristopher eventually gravitated away from pop music when his long time interest in the nature of the human mind and spirit became full time research. Based on new knowledge from research in quantum physics, Christopher's current work involves the creation of music and sound improvisations that can transport the listener to new realms of experience. Christopher sensed that high technology combined with knowledge of the human mind and spirit can potentially elevate the human consciousness.\n\nishwish utilizes advanced computer synthesis designed specifically to manipulate, and alter audio vibrations in real-time. Each ishwish performance becomes a unique and personal experience to each listener. An important factor in ishwish music is improvisation. When music is created in \"present time\", a special energy happens. That energy is unique because it remains long after the actual performance is finished, still influencing the people and the environment.\n\n\"It is crucial towards this goal, to create performances that are influenced first by the immediate environment, which then act as a departure point to transport the audience to another time and place,\" says Christopher.\n\n\"Sound is a vibration.

Early Music: \"an unusual disc combining sparkling virtuosity with carefully paced musicianship\".\n\nBlack Cow\nJacob's second album, Lute music by Valentin Bakfark and Matthaeus Waissel, was Jacob's first appearance on Robert Fripp's DGM label. Renaissance Magazine: \"a dedicated, disciplined, and courageous talent\".\n\nJosquin Des Prez\nHis third album (again for DGM), the first lute CD ever to be devoted to the music of the great Josquin Des Prez, was released in the summer of 2000, and has received numerous superlative reviews, noteably in Gramophone and BBC Music Magazine. It had already attracted attention and a cover story in Early Music Today even before its release.

Strongly recommended.\"\n\nJane Pickeringe's Lute Book\nJacob's fourth solo CD is on the new AVIE label; entitled Jane Pickeringe's Lute Book, it was released in June of 2002, and has also been highly acclaimed in the music press. Music Week: \"It is impossible not to marvel at the dexterity of Heringman's finger work and very easy to be convinced by his inspired phrasing and winning sense of spontaneity.\" The Independent: \"Deliciously wanton yet sensitive playing\".\n\nThe Art of the Lute Player\nA fifth, entitled The Art of the Lute Player, was released in October 2002. This disc is a compilation of material from the first three solo CDs, plus solo tracks from the ASV Milan and Mudarra albums made with the singer Catherine King (see discography page). Gramophone: \"The supple expressivity of the performances reflects Heringman's love of the music. What more is there to be said, other than to urge anyone with an interest in this small but very lush musical pasture to buy it without delay.\"\n\nThe Siena Lute Book\nJacob's sixth and latest solo CD is now out on AVIE (0036), released in the spring of 2004.

In recent years, he made numerous tours of the USA and Canada performing both the Josquin and Pickeringe programmes.\n\nAs an accompanist, Jacob Heringman has performed and recorded lute songs with Michael Chance and Barbara Bonney, among others. He is also half of a duo with the mezzo-soprano Catherine King, with whom he has toured extensively and recorded four lute song discs for ASV and Linn, all of which have been greeted with high praise from reviewers. One of these, entitled Airs de Cour, for which the duo was joined by the tenor Charles Daniels, was voted one of the top CDs of 1999 by both Gramophone and the BBC Music Magazine.\n\nIn 1990, Jacob founded the group Virelai with viol player Susanna Pell, singer Catherine King, and flute-player William Lyons. Virelai specialises in music of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, with occasional forays into modern music. Virelai has made three CDs for Virgin, and a BBC Music Magazine cover CD. A CD of specially commissioned modern settings of renaissance love poetry, entitled Sad Steps, was released by Riverrun Records late in 2002.\n\nJacob teaches the lute at Trinity College of Music, London, and at York University. He is increasingly in demand as a teacher at various Lute Society and other early music summer schools, including the American Lute Society's courses in Vancouver, Cleveland and Amherst, the UK Lute Society's course at Hengrave Hall, and Musica Antiqua's course at the Cambridge Early Music Summer Schools.\n\nThe Alexander Technique is another important strand of Jacob's life and work. A year ago, he finished the three-year full-time Alexander Technique teacher training course at The Alexander Technique Studio in London, run by Karen Wentworth, and is now a qualified teacher of the Alexander Technique certified by the Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique (STAT). Increasingly, Jacob has found principles of the Technique to be indispensible in his music-making and teaching, and he is teaching the Alexander Technique to increasing numbers of musicians and non-musicians alike.\n\nJacob is married to Susanna Pell, of Fretwork and The Dufay Collective, and they live on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales with their young daughter, Edie.",

James was born in Scotland and began playing guitar at the age of 10.\n\nInitially playing rock and blues then attempting to play jazz and finally settling on classical guitar, he was largely self-taught before having lessons with Robert Mackillop at Napier University, Edinburgh. Whilst at Napier he turned his attentions to playing the lute and pursued this, at the Royal College of Music, London, studying with Jakob Lindberg. Adding theorbo to his expanding instrument collection, James continued his studies at Trinity College of Music with Jacob Heringman and David Miller with additional lessons and advice from Paul O'Dette and Elizabeth Kenny.\n\nHaving settled on the period instrument path James continued accumulating instruments and exploring the music of the 16th to 19th centuries, with occasional forays into contemporary music.\n\nFollowing a Junior Fellowship at Trinity College of Music James began pursuing a varied professional career. As a soloist he has performed mostly in the UK and Scandinavia giving recitals for The Yorke Music Trust, Ullapool Guitar Festival, Classical Guitar Retreat, Exeter Guitar Festival and the Copenhagen Renaissance Music Festival.\n\nHe has accompanied leading Early Music singers including Dame Emma Kirkby, James Bowman, Michael Chance, Miriam Allan, Gabriela Di Laccio and Sam Bowden and performed with many early music ensembles such as I Fagiolini, Ex Cathedra, Fretwork, The Parley of Instruments, The Hanover Band, Sounds Baroque and the Dunedin Consort.\n\nAs a continuo player James has worked for major opera companies, English National Opera, Welsh National Opera, Opera North and Innsbruck Festival Opera and orchestras and chamber groups including The Scottish, Irish and English Chamber Orchestras, Northern Sinfonia, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, The Scottish Ensemble, with trumpeter Alison Balsom, and ventured into other styles with Damon Albarn, the Sonnets and the genre-hopping ensemble Il Festino.\n\nJames has performed on numerous recordings; a few film soundtracks, including Ridley Scott's Robin Hood and Justin and the Knights of Valour; several theatrical stages, including Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and the Barbican, and broadcast for the BBC, France Musique and RTE Lyric, Ireland.\n\nJames teaches early guitar, lute and theorbo at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow and is a visiting lecturer at Aberdeen University.\n\nAlthough mostly concentrating on performing and teaching, James has occasionally indulged in research, exploring the domestic music making of Samuel Pepys and his 'musical secretary' Cesare Morelli, the polyphony of Scottish Renaissance composer David Peebles and, most recently, the Scottish influence on European guitarist composers at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nYou can find out more about James on his website.",

As the 2002 national hammered dulcimer champion, Jamie is reinventing the way hammered dulcimer used by being the leading purveyor of a new style called dulcitronica!\n\nIntricately layered soundscapes evolve from dense textural grooves to spacious ethereal ambience using a custom hammered dulcimer, miniature drum kit and the magic of digital technology. Jamie brings new direction to the hammered dulcimer by applying diverse percussive techniques drawn from some of the other instruments he plays: drums, mini-kit, multi-percussion, tabla, congas, bongos, timbales, and udu. His background as a drummer gives him a totally different approach to the hammered dulcimer than traditional players. His style is characterized by a symbiotic interplay between rhythm and melody, laying down deep intricate grooves and not being afraid to take the listener into new realms of the timbral universe.\n\nSince moving to Boulder, Colorado in 1995, Jamie has played with a diverse group of bands including, ZILLA, Zuvuya, The Motet, The Theory Of Everything, Vibe Squad, The Zambiland Orchestra, Chupacabra, and his own band, Jamie Janover and the Realms Ensemble, among many others.\n\nJamie is also a veteran of hundreds of live guest appearances having performed with Phish, Stanley Jordan, Bela Fleck, The String Cheese Incident , Leftover Salmon, Keller Williams, The Jazz Mandolin Project, Sector 9, The Slip, Govt Mule, Tony Furtado, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Warren Haynes, Sam Bush, Derrek Trucks, Future Man, Stanton Moore, members of the Rebirth Brass Band, The Dead, Big Head Todd and the Monsters and The Yonder Mountain String Band, among many others.\n\nJamie has appeared on over 30 commercial CD releases including recordings by The String Cheese Incident, G. Love and Special Sauce, Keller Williams, Garaj Mahal, Shanti Groove, Chupacabra and Stephen Halpern. He has performed at venues and festivals across the country including the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, N.W. Festival of Jazz and Wine, Red Rocks Amphitheater, Tippitina's in New Orleans and The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.\n\nA world traveler, Jamie has played not just in the U.S. and Canada, but also in Africa (for the Masai of Kenya), India and Australia. His live performances have included everything from solo hammered dulcimer concerts, to playing in bands on drum kit, percussion, hammered dulcimer or didjeridoo. Jamie also does hammered dulcimer workshops, school assemblies, weddings and accompanies dance and theater performances.\n\nJamie Janover's music is diverse in scope and so have been the ways in which it has been used. Janover's music has been used for television and video soundtracks, theater and dance performances, meditation practices and massage videos. His work has been treated in several nationally circulated publications including Dirty Linen, Relix, Dulcimer Player News, and Mountain Freak and has been featured on the NPR radio programs \"All Things Considered\" and \"New Sounds\".\n\nAn incredible new step in Jamie's creative output was his invention of the \"Realms Mobile\", which is a musical vehicle! The \"Realms Mobile\" is a recumbent tricycle, attached to which is a mini-simulated drumkit. This enables Jamie to play drums with both hands and pedal around at the same time! He brings it out at large festivals including Burning Man.\n\nWith each new project, new album, new band, new instrument comes another step in the continued evolution of Jamie's creative process. He continues to cross-pollinate both genres and mediums in his continual exploration into the infinite realms of the creative process. Perhaps best known for his musical abilities, Jamie is also a professional photographer. Janover is a truly multi-talented and totally unique artist in the broadest sense of the term.",

During these studies he received offers for short film and advertisement scoring. This had a huge influence in helping Jarkko realize this was the kind of thing he really wanted to do in his life.

    "bio": "Magnatune recording and performing artist, former Visiting Artist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, rostered artist for the Kennedy Center, and panel member for the development of the ethno-musicology program at Peabody Conservatory, sitar and surbahar virtuoso Jay Kishor brings to the art of the electric guitar an intense discipline in world music culminating from an intensive fifteen year period of study in India in the traditional \"master-disciple\" training from a number of renowned masters (Nabaganashyam Singh, John Bell, Dr. Allyn Miner, Manju Mehta, Brij Bhushan Kabra, Dr. Rajbhan Singh, Rooshikumar Pandya, Annapurna Devi) after having been awarded a Ford Fellowship.\n\nRaised in America, Jay combines elements from world, European classical, jazz, Blues, country and rock music and deftly incorporates his extensive knowledge of Ragas (ancient Indian melodies) into his improvisations. Jay approaches the guitar as a storyteller in the language of music.\n\nAs a sitarist, he worked closely with guitarist Michael Hedges and toured and recorded with guitarist Stanley Jordan (Ragas, State of Nature), has released several classical sitar works as well as forming his band touchingGrace and recording \"The Gandhi Memorial Concert\" with his group, The Rajdhani Quartet. His debut solo guitar album, \"Stories from My Grandfather's Village\", and the album \"Rare\" from his duo thirty3 demonstrate a guitar style that reflects an intuitive ability to improvise melodic lines that capture the heart and transport the soul.\n\n\"My study of North Indian Classical music was in a discipline that is largely based on improvisation. This experience revealed to me that improvised music is the most honest expression of who I am at any given moment.\n\nThe question obviously arises as to why I switched from sitar to electric guitar. The simple answer is that I need to define my instrument, not have my instrument define me.\n\nKeeping in mind that my aim, my ultimate purpose for music is to express myself honestly, I abandoned the idea of teaching myself the guitar via the paths of the overwhelming guitar pedagogy available. I spent a great deal of time studying masters of the instrument and translating technique developed over a 25 year relationship with the sitar and Indian classical music. More so than playing sitar on the guitar, my journey has been to express myself rather than to be an ambassador of some tradition, be it either western or eastern. I needed to express myself, my aesthetic.\n\nThe sitar has a unique and distinct voice, a voice that is inherently tied to the history and culture that is India, and irrespective of the musical context, this connection to all that is \"India\" will always be a dominating presence.\n\nI needed an instrument that had an \"open\" tonal signature; one that was tonally versatile enough to allow me the capability of altering or affecting the tone so that it best serves whatever genre, whatever palette I wish to work in. The electric guitar also enables me to better realize my personal tonal aesthetic, what I think sounds beautiful. As a sitarist, I experimented with different kinds of wood, different thicknesses of wood, different string gauges, different string materials, and different tunings, all in an attempt to get away from that stereotypical sitar tone, what I called at the time \"psychedelic-banjo\". I later realized that all along I was trying to make my sitar sound closer to a guitar.\n\nIndian classical music is predominantly a solo form of music. In a classical recital there are two parts: one solo and the other with rhythm accompaniment, and although the exchange between the soloist and the Indian drums (tabla) can be very lively and entertaining, the form is more of a \"call and response\" rather than being characterized by interaction and creativity. Duets (jugulbandhi) are a recent addition to Indian classical music, but these, too, are built more on \"taking turns\" rather than on a symbiotic approach to the music. The electric guitar gave me an opportunity to improvise at a high level with other musicians, within other styles, in the language of music. I have always approached music as a storyteller, intuitively recognizing it as a language. The sound of the electric guitar is better able to blend within the confines and contexts of various musical surroundings rather than drawing attention away because of an overtly distinctive tonal fingerprint.\n\nBeing a first generation Indo-American raised in a culturally traditional household but growing up in a culturally diverse environment made expressing who I am complex. I needed an instrument that was open enough to explore whichever form of music I chose to engage in, and the guitar was the instrument that I had wanted to play since childhood.\n\nI aim to create and build an approach to music that has the power to heal, to edify and to transcend both listeners and the musicians who are its stewards. I want to create a form of music that is constantly growing and evolving - one which makes musicians grow and listeners evolve. Most importantly, I want this music to break the boundaries created by culture, religion and geography. Raga is the foundation of my methodology, which I am calling 'organic music'.\"\n\n~ Jay Kishor\n\n   Photo credit: Doug Miller",

The inspiration for all of my songs is always a particular emotion I'm experiencing. I usually compose with the guitar in altered tunings so that I can't analyze the sounds through traditional music theory. Although I have a degree in music composition, I find it much more satisfying and authentic to compose through intuition rather than relying on rules of theory. Composing in this way keeps me humble to what the instrument wants to say and helps with keeping my ego out of the way when I write music.\"\n\nJeff's music has been featured often on local and national public radio programs during the last several years.

An experienced song writer and performer, Kevin started his musical career in the early 90's with the Pittsburgh band Big Bean Theory, where he began experimenting with effects and unorthodox use of his guitar to create new sounds during live performances.\n\nWhen the band split in 1998, Kevin moved to New York to explore some fresh musical ideas. Intrigued by the challenge of communicating complex emotional states through seemingly simple musical compositions, Kevin honed his craft for the next 7 years through collaborations with theater groups, performance artists, and film makers in and around New York City. During this time, he also returned to the stage with the Brooklyn post rock ensemble Rahu-Ketu and started work on a solo project that would become Jesus in Japan.\n\nIn the midst of busy collaborations and the high energy environment of New York, Jesus in Japan was born out of a need to express something more personal, more reflective. Contemplative, and highly nuanced, the music of Jesus in Japan is refuge, a quiet place in a world spinning out of control, and an invitation to look inside.",

Joe's playing and writing was also influenced by acoustic greats like Cat Stevens, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor and Neil Young.\n\nIn the late 70's, he heard Wes Montgomery's album Bumpin' and was hooked. At 19, he started studying with jazz-legend Pat Martino in nearby Philadelphia until he couldn't resist the pull of the music scene in New York City.\n\nNew York provided hundreds of opportunities to play with a wide range of artists and study with interesting teachers. In the early 80's Joe played in the power samba group \"Pe De Boi\" put together by Brazilian percussionist Guilherme Franco. Since Franco was also in Keith Jarrett's American Band, many top players like Dave Liebman and Curtis Fuller sat in with the band frequently. They played NYC underground spots like SOB's and the Jazz Forum.\n\nJoe also played in jazz duos and trios, with guitarists Leni Stern and Wayne Krantz in Village restaurants and clubs, and with bassist Jeff Andrews on the Upper West Side. He's also played with jazz bassoonist Michael Rabinowitz of the Charlie Mingus tribute band, the Mingus Dynasty. A highlight was playing Carnegie Hall in 1997 with Sting, and Kenny Kirkland on piano for an Elton John AIDS benefit.\n\nAfter a good 20 years of city, Joe packed up his guitars and his two dogs and moved north to Woodstock NY for a little green. He formed a jazz trio, Less Deluxe, (including Steve Winwood drummer Eric Parker) and kept playing gigs in New York City. Joe met his lovely wife Jennifer when she took his NYC yoga class - they moved to Atlanta, where he has played in Kola Ogunkoya's Afro-beat Ensemble and is co-leader of a kirtan band, Dhvani.

That was when he fell in love with music and understood melody as a powerful tool for expressing emotion. Now fast forward through a successful career as an electronic dance music artist to 2006 when he started writing song-based melodic Downtempo music.\n\nHis newest release, Don't Wake Me, features unique cuts full of texture and emotion and uses a myriad of sounds, from soothing keyboards to jazz flute. Growing up, he was influenced by 80's British pop like Depeche Mode and New Order; while you can hear the melodic elements of their work in his, he's gone in a whole different direction with this new chillout release. He thinks like a great cinematographer, with moving melodic lines and layers of innovative sounds presenting a vivid story. Sometimes the songs sound like a movie soundtrack.\n\nJoey comes from a long line of professional musicians including aunts and uncles who played for everything from symphonies to commercial jingles. He's been writing music since he was thirteen and for the past twenty, he's produced electronic music, starting with an old Mac Plus and a few old analog keyboards and an 8-bit sampler. For nine years he recorded dance tracks under the name Dream Traveler. One of his songs,\" Time,\" appeared on Paul Oakenfold's Transport CD, one of the highest selling dance compilations of all time.\n\nIn 2006 he switched direction and started using his real name. \"I wanted a more personal connection to the listener and the only name I could put on it was my own. Band names tend to mask the artist's identity. There's nothing more intrinsic than putting your real name on an album, and there's nothing more personal than writing the most emotional music you can to try to express to others who you really are.\" His goal was to eliminate boundaries and write emotionally charged, melodic music. He even self-released his first album on his own record label to avoid any outside influence.\n\nHis music has been used on TV shows like Steven Seagal: Lawman, History Detectives, and Earth 2100: ABC Special Report. Two of his songs, \"Behold\" and \"Being Around You,\" were included on Nick Warren's Global Underground - Paris compilation.\n\nHis earlier release, Mellowdrama, topped Downtempo and Chillout radio charts and sold record numbers over the past four years. Before that, as Dream Traveler, he released numerous dance singles and remixes that became dance floor favorites, played by DJs including John Digweed, Sasha, Nick Warren, and Scott Stubbs. Joey's music has been enjoyed by thousands all over the globe. You may not be four but this is emotionally satisfying music you'll want to listen to every night.\n\nYou can find out more about Joey on his website.",

He has attracted plaudits from the press for his solo recordings, which includes a disc sonatas, suites and concertos with organist Iain Simcock (by Albinoni and his contemporaries), available from 2010 on Magnatune as 'Baroque Trumpet and Organ'. With John Wallace, in 2004, he released a disc of works by Rheinberger, Strauss and Elgar entitled 'The Trumpets that Time Forgot' (Linn Records), heralding a series of recordings exploring ways in which the trumpet can, retrospectively, be 'written into' established traditions of mainstream solo and chamber music. The success of 'La Trompette Retrouvee' - in which he plays his re-working of Faure's Violin Sonata No. 2 in E minor - led to the award-winning 'Trumpet Masque' of unusual 17th-century 're-imaginings', described in Metro as 'extraordinary playing switching between fizzy fireworks and tender pathos with ease' and BBC Music Magazine as 'a decidedly unconventional and intelligently produced recital representing modern trumpet-playing and programming at its best'.\n\nHis career also extends to recording producer for many independent labels.

The success of 'La Trompette Retrouvee' - in which he plays his re-working of Faure's Violin Sonata No. 2 in E minor - led to the award-winning 'Trumpet Masque' of unusual 17th-century 're-imaginings', described in Metro as 'extraordinary playing switching between fizzy fireworks and tender pathos with ease' and BBC Music Magazine as 'a decidedly unconventional and intelligently produced recital representing modern trumpet-playing and programming at its best'.\n\nJonathan Freeman-Attwood's career also extends to recording producer for many independent labels. Several of his productions have won major awards, including six Gramophone Awards for Ockeghem's Requiem with the Clerk's Group (ASV), Purcell's Fantazias (Simax) and Gibbons' 6-part Fantasias (AVIE) with Phantasm as well as Vivaldi's 'La Stravaganza' Concertos with Rachel Podger and L'Arte di Suonatore (Channel Classics). He has recorded all Bach's unaccompanied violin music with Podger and the accompanied sonatas with Trevor Pinnock (Channel Classics), the large-scale works of Byrd, Gibbons, Lawes and Jenkins with Phantasm, chamber recordings with Podger, Pinnock and Jonathan Manson, Tallis and Byrd with The Cardinall's Music (Hyperion) and miscellaneous discs for Naxos, Chandos and BIS.\n\nHe continues to be active as a critic, lecturer and contributor to many publications (most recently, the new Cambridge University Press's 'Companion to Recorded Music'), as well as for The New Grove (2nd edition) and he broadcasts regularly for BBC Radio 3. He is an established authority on Bach interpretation, particularly as it challenges and refocuses historical perspectives on 'performance practices' and - in more pedagogical contexts - how recordings of the past can influence current priorities and tastes.\n\n\"outstanding playing which explores a dynamic range of lively dialogue and solo lyricism in virtuoso style\" (Observer)\n\n\"playing notable for the beauty and freedom of line and lyrical phrasing, while the bravura is exhilarating\" (Gramophone)\n\n\"Freeman-Attwood's masterful playing has been captured spectacularly\" (Soundstage)\n\n\"Freeman-Attwood's tone is bright, clean and precise and he delivers performances of narrative elegance devoid of any in-your-face brassiness\", (International Record Review)\n\n\"a project whose every facet declares itself handsomely devised and superbly realised\" (BBC Music Magazine)\n\n\"we can applaud his clean-cut rhythmicality, his fine legato line, his musicianly moulding of phrases and his brilliant virtuosity\" (Gramophone)\n\nJonathan also released Bach connections with Colm Carey on Magnatune.\n\nIain Simcock was organ scholar at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and Christ Church, Oxford, before being appointed Sub-Organist at Westminster Abbey and, for seven years, Assistant Master of Music at Westminster Cathedral. He was the first British prize-winner in the Chartres International Organ Competition and studied with David Sanger in London and Jean Langlais in Paris.\n\nHe recorded several CDs for Hyperion Records with the choir of Westminster Cathedral as well as several solo organ recordings, including two Symphonies by Louis Vierne and notably the world premiere recording of Christus - A Passion Symphony for Organ by Francis Pott. During this period, recital tours took him all over Europe as well as to Australia. He also appeared regularly on BBC radio and television and played in two BBC Proms concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. He gave many duo concerts during this time with Jonathan Freeman-Attwood (trumpet).\n\nSince living in France, Iain has been professor of choral singing at the Conservatoire National in Angers and organist at the Abbey of Saint Pierre in Solesmes, whilst continuing his solo freelance career. He performed the complete organ works of Bach in Angers in 1996 recording a solo CD of highlights from the performances. He also performed all Bach's major harpsichord works including the Goldberg Variations on the famous Taskin harpsichord in the Russell collection at the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nIn 2000 Iain Simcock became Musical Director of the Maitrise de l'Academie Vocale de Paris, which he has built into the most ambitious choral project in France. The Maitrise travels increasingly, giving concerts of a vast repertoire of great choral music from Manchicourt to MacMillan. He also works with the opera houses in Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux, preparing young singers for roles in Britten A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Turn of the Screw, Debussy Pelleas et Melisande, Berlioz Damnation of Faust, Mozart Magic Flute and as assistant to Jane Glover and harpsichordist for Handel Jephtha.",

He is a highly educated guitarist and a very active composer and art Painter.\n\nKaare Norge's talent has drawn him into a wide range of achievements, and he has piorneered in a lot of areas. He was the first Danish classical musician to release a CD from a rock -company,Genlyd (BMG), he was the first Danish classical musician to create a video, he was the first classical artist to perform at the world famous \"Roskildefestivalen\" - in front of no less than 60.000 entusiastic spectators. Furthermore he has set new standards as to how a classical performer promotes him self. In this respect he has given numerous interviews on TV, radio, papers, magazines and the Internet.\n\nKaare Norge has contributed richly to the international body of guitar literature, above all by his highly appraised transcription - and first recording of - \"Partita No. 4 for Harpsicord in D major, BWV 828\" by Johann Sebastian Bach - but certainly also his transcriptions of Bach's Goldberg Variations, Sonata no. 8 in g-minor by Scarlatti, Sonata K. 331 by Mozart and his \"Tango Jalousie\", by the Danish composer, Jacob Gade, have also claimed fame.\n\nAs a composer Kaare Norges reputation is on the rise. His \"Homage to Life\", his first composition to be released on cd, and originally written as a theme to a Danish TV-program - is now being regarded as a modern classic, and is to be found in the repertoire of every hopeful young Danish guitarist.\n\nKaare Norge has given recitals throughout the world, from Greenland to China, from Bolivia to all over Europe, and his master classes are extremely well-sought. In Denmark he is one of a rather few, whose concerts are almost always sold out. About 3500 times he has been the target of grateful applauders, some of whom have been members of the Danish, royal family. Thus he has played before Queen Margrethe d. 2. at her twenty fifth anniversary - as well as when the then newly wed Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited Aarhus for the first time.\n\nBut, all the above being mentioned, Kaare Norges foremost importance as an artist lies within his recording. He has released 18 CD's, 1DVD and is a performer on several other cds and internationally renowned critics, as Colin Cooper and Alan Miteran, have labelled him a world class record-performer. They have e.g. formulated their admiration as follows:\n\n\"Kaare Norge has refined a technique, which allows him to play without the disturbing noises, one so often must endure, when listening to other guitarists moving their fingers on the strings. In other words, Kaare Norges CD's are of a purity and fastidiousness, one is rarely to experience.\"\n\n\"Kaare Norges technique enables him to play the prestissimo in a way, that is absolutely breathtaking. It is so fast, you don't believe it, and yet every note is crystal clear. And Kaare Norges feeling enables him to play the rubato, in such a way, that the listener is forced to hold his breath when waiting for the next pitch.\"\n\nVisit Kaare's website",

Delivering the magic of Kaissa's voice is only the start for this remarkable artist.\n\nHailing from the Republic of Cameroon and its vibrant culture, Kaissa has become an unmistakable representative of African music to the planet. An aural artisan whose music paints a lush, vivid picture of the ever-changing world around her, Kaissa's voice simultaneously showcases warmth, appreciation, struggle and resilience - delivered via striking performances that are full of light.\n\nKaissa's origins in an artistic land were reinforced by her equally artistic family. Her mother was a seamstress, her father was a writer, and her siblings could have banded themselves together with their talents on bass, guitar, vocals, dance and painting. In the 1970's, the arrest of Kaissa's father for having written a \"subversive\" book against the new Cameroonian government would prove pivotal, paving the way for her obsession with justice and an equal distaste for the political machine.\n\n\"My father's jailing was a life-changing experience,\" Kaissa recalls. \"I felt the fragility of life itself. I understood that art is a healing thing, and that I have a responsibility to sing about all facets of life because all forms of injustice matter and we as artists can initiate the change.\"\n\nNow, with the release of her first album, LOOKING THERE under her belt, the NYC-based Kaissa's upcoming record balances her humanitarian outlook with exuberant messages of joy, love, hope, optimism and celebration. Holding it all together is the emotional focus of her stunningly beautiful, powerful, yet silky voice.\n\n\"I realized a long time ago that my purpose in life is to use my talent for the struggle against racism, sexism, homophobia, poverty and all other forms of social and internalized oppressions,\" she says. \"As a musician, I continuously strive to use my talents to not only entertain, but also educate and rejuvenate the community by bringing a message of love, peace and happiness to as many lives as I can through my words and music and my dedication to both.\"\n\nThe organizations she's joined up with take on some of the toughest problems on the planet: She is Action Against Hunger's Advisory Council member, one of her songs will be featured on the 2011 music CD compilation of WHOA on ending Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Kaissa is also a member of Artists for Freedom, a global alliance of artists fighting against global human trafficking and modern-day slavery. Finally, the Keep the World Foundation is also keeping Kaissa busy, as they work to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women.\n\nOutside the studio, Kaissa's star keeps rising with appearances from Paris to Yaounde via Warsaw and back to NYC - all part of a rich career that has seen Kaissa collaborating or performing with the likes of Manu Dibango, Salif Keita, Jean-Michel Jarre, Cesaria Evora, Martha Wash, David Byrne, and Diana Ross.\n\nHer performances were highlighted by a personal invitation from Paul Simon to sing his songs for his Brooklyn Academy of Music Love in Hard Times career retrospective - an honor she shared along with David Byrne, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, The Roches, Olu Dara, Josh Groban, Grizzly Bear, and others, accompanied by the Paul Simon Band and the master songwriter himself on guitar. \"It was an unforgettable experience\", Kaissa recalls.\n\nWith her music and a mindset that speaking out really does matter, Kaissa is on track to make a difference to people, in more ways than one. She explains simply: \"I like to say this: The world is a village - our village - and we can better it. Together.\"\n\nYou can find out more about Kaissa on her website.",

Kalotone is the creation of UK musician and producer Jake Colquhoun.\n\nJake was raised in the deep, dark and gritty underworld of Brixton which has become the birthplace of the fast growing music genre Dubstep. Dubstep is a mutation of dub and UK garage but is rapidly gaining sub-genres to please all music lovers worldwide.\n\nJake started out as a guitarist in rock bands to reggae bands but always produced solo ambient and electro material on the side. Jake is a multi-instrumentalist but also engineers and produces his work with the help and experience from music technology qualifications. Jake's influences are sporadically plucked from each and every genre and the clear crossovers of genres are projected and illustrated in his music.\n\nAfter the huge explosion of Dubstep in England and the slow spread of admiration for the genre over the globe, Jake has spilled into the scene while still keeping other genres tucked neatly alongside. The combination of genres makes Kalotone's music inspiringly elusive and artistic.

I set out on a journey to face myself and to learn the scope of my own being. Beautiful music has to come from a beautiful place in yourself. At a young age I decided to discover that place.\"\n\nIn his early twenties, through reading one of his books, Sambodhi became inspired by the enlightened mystic Osho. About music Osho has said: \"Music helps you from the outside to fall in tune with the inner. Music is a device; it was invented by the buddhas. Listening to great music you suddenly become silent - with no effort. Falling in tune with the music you lose your ego with no effort. You become relaxed, you fall into a deep rest. You are alert, awake, and yet in a subtle way drunk.\"\n\nSambodhi Prem lives together with Deva Sandipa in Mount Franklin, Victoria, Australia, where the sounds of his studio resonate with the abundance of nature.\n\nFind out more about Sambodhi's work via his Magnatune solo project, website and Sacred Concerts' site.",

Since that time Perl has developed both a unique teaching and playing style for which she has become well known-one that celebrates the dynamic and expressive aspects of the harpsichord and is influenced by the American idioms of blues and jazz.\n\nWhile conventional ideas of the harpsichord hold that it does not allow for variation in volume, Perl's powerful playing overturns this perception, and mines the expressive capacity of the instrument. Her innovative approach has been termed \"sound sculpture.\"\n\nMs. Perl's first recording, Pieces de Clavecin, Music of Louis Couperin was nominated for Best Baroque Recording of French music in 1993, in Paris. The second recording, Music of Jacques Duphly, was released in 1998 on the Dorian label and most recently Perl's independent recording of four of Bach's French Suites has been made available on Magnatune. Bach's classic composition for harpsichord, The Well-Tempered Clavier, has now become the center of Perl's artistic attention and future recordings and releases are in the works.\n\nIn addition to her performing, teaching, and recording activities, Katherine Roberts Perl is an esteemed harpsichord technician, serving the Bay Area. She and her husband Mark produce a concert series/salon in their home in San Francisco called Chattanooga Chamber Music, which consists of four live music performances every fall and spring.\n\n\"I consider myself extremely fortunate that my life thus far has been contemporary with many great masters,\" says Perl, \"who have shown the way for practitioners of early music performance in my own generation and the next: musicians such as Gustav Leonhardt, the Kuijken brothers and Hopkinson Smith, to name a few.\" She adds, \"My mission in life is to play the music of Bach, Couperin and others on the harpsichord with clarity and grace, and to teach others what it takes to do so. Meaningful expression is an elusive thing, and so wondrous when it is achieved.\"\n\nAdditional Praise for Katherine Roberts Perl:\n\n\"The key to Roberts' success is her fluent but precise rhythmic sense. She has a way of springing the rhythm, drawing out the line, waiting until the last possible moment before attacking a note without damaging the onward flow in the slightest. Strength and delicacy, nuance and bite seemed available in abundance...a fluent but precise rhythmic sense.\" -Charles Shere, Oakland Tribune\n\n\"She genuinely captured the essence of accurate, sensitive and stylistic French keyboard playing...the audience was enraptured...passion and fire.\" -Ruta Bloomfield, Iowa city",

After learning the standard classical repertoire, she became enamored with the music written before 1750 and the Baroque style in particular. At Indiana University she studied the great works and also the art of ensemble accompaniment, otherwise known as basso continuo, and mastered the principles of rendering figured bass into the fabric of every ensemble performance. Katherine's performances as a continuo player can be heard in the texture of many recordings with some of the finest artists in historical performance.\n\nThis improvisatory style is a joy to play and informs her performance of all the keyboard genres she plays. She also works frequently in the contemporary music realm, and has incorporated new music, jazz, and performance art elements in many of her endeavors as well as actively pursuing jazz piano, where she applies the foundation of basso continuo to the keyboard comping and soloing that's so integral to jazz performance.\n\nIn addition to her many endeavors as a performer, Katherine also works as a consultant for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nYou can find out more about Katherine on her Youtube page.",

The lyrics testify the raising consciousness about the lack of communication between people, the degeneration of which can lead to war, to the destruction of the environment and generally speaking, to the sense of estrangement of modern societies.\n\nIn 2007 Fabio Properzi cooperated with Corrado Rustici on the album 'Deconstruction of Postmodern Musician' for which he wrote and sung \"Chiudi gli occhi\".\n\nRoberto Matarrese is active in the music field since he was a kid. Born in a family of musicians, he started to play keyboard and guitar at the age of 11.\n\nIn his teenage years, he played in several bands as guitarist. In the meanwhile, combining his two main interests, music and computers, he became interested in the world of electronic music. He started to produce electronic music in 1997, at the age of 15.\n\nImmediately after taking his degree in computer science, he got interested sound engineering. In his career as a sound engineer and producer, he worked with many italian bands and artists, in studio as well as live, and worked on projects that have been produced by various Italian labels, like Universal Music Italy, Sugar Music, Carosello, Rai Trade, etc.\n\nHe's also active in contemporary arts. He participated as sound artist for many installations, including interactive ones. Roberto is also a sound engeneering researcher for the University of Architecture of Bari (Italy). His band, besides Kinky Atoms, is LogisticDubLab, an experimental music project combining live electronic music with drums and guitars.\n\nBrains can be electronic, computer core can be human.",

    "description": "Eastern European women's vocal music",
    "bio": "Kitka is a professional women's vocal ensemble dedicated to producing concerts, recordings, and educational programs that develop new audiences for music rooted in Eastern European women's vocal traditions. Kitka also strives to expand the boundaries of this music as an expressive art form. Kitka's mission is accomplished through a busy itinerary of live performances, including a San Francisco Bay Area home concert series; regional, national, and international touring programs; community service activities and workshops; in-school programs; radio, television and internet broadcasts; recording and music publication projects; master artist residencies; commissioning programs; and adventuresome collaborations.\n\nHistory\n\nFounded in 1979, Kitka began as a grassroots group of amateur singers from diverse backgrounds who met regularly to share their passion for the stunning dissonances, asymmetric rhythms, intricate ornamentation, lush harmonies, and resonant strength of Eastern European women's vocal music. Under the direction of Bon Singer from 1981 to 1996, Kitka blossomed into a refined professional ensemble earning international renown for its artistry, versatility, and mastery of the demanding techniques of traditional and contemporary Balkan, Slavic, and Caucasian vocal styling. Under the co-direction of Shira Cion, Juliana Graffagna, and Janet Kutulas since 1997, Kitka has grown to earn recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts, Chorus America, and the American Choral Directors' Association as one of this country's premier touring vocal ensembles. In addition, many international musical authorities consider Kitka the foremost interpreter of Balkan and Slavic choral repertoire working in the United States.\n\nKitka has deep ties to Eastern Europe and has traveled there to perform and collect repertoire many times. In 2002, Kitka joined Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares as \"international guests of honor\" for this world-renowned choir's 50th Anniversary Gala at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia, Bulgaria. In 2005, supported by a major grant from the Trust for Mutual Understanding, Kitka journeyed to Ukraine for a series of performances, international artist-exchange meetings, radio and television broadcasts, and research expeditions in rural villages. Kitka's singers regularly conduct fieldwork in ethnic communities throughout America as well as abroad. Individual Kitka members have researched and collected songs in Bulgaria, Hungary, Macedonia, Georgia, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Many of Kitka's singers are also talented composers and arrangers who create original settings of songs they have gathered in the field.\n\nKitka's unique sound and innovative sense of programming has led to dozens of other fruitful collaborations, ranging from a reconstruction of the medieval Carmina Burana pageant for CalPerformances, (Thomas Binkley, director), to work with Hollywood composers and independent film-makers on motion picture soundtracks including Braveheart, Jacob's Ladder, and Queen of the Damned. Other collaborations of note include creating the role of the Greek Chorus/Trojan Slave Women in the American Conservatory Theater's three critically-acclaimed performance runs of Hecuba (Carey Perloff, Director) for which Kitka received a Drama Critic's Circle Award nomination; the creation of Women in Black, a multi-disciplinary work inspired by the international Women in Black Against War Movement (Thais Mazur, choreographer; Katrina Wreede composer) for which Kitka received an Izzie award nomination for best musical contribution to a dance program; and Songs from Mama's Table, a celebration of the commonalties and contrasts between Balkan, Slavic and African American women's singing traditions with Grammy nominees Linda Tillery and the Cultural Heritage Choir. In March 2007, Kitka, in collaboration with composer Dan Cantrell, Yiddish folk singer, multi-instrumentalist and dancer Michael Alpert; Balkan Romani multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Rumen Sali Shopov; and stage director Aaron Davidman premiered Musical Fortunes, a new song cycle inspired by the intersection of Eastern European Jewish and Romani (\"Gypsy\") cultures.\n\nIn 2000, Kitka received major grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rockefeller Foundation's MAP Fund to launch the New Folksongs Commissioning Project, which engages some of the most exciting voices in contemporary music to write new works that utilize Kitka's wide-ranging sound palette. New Folksongs commissions premiered to date include compositions by Pauline Oliveros, Chen Yi, Dan Cantrell, Marcel Khalife, Janet Kutulas, David Lang, Linda Tillery, Sara Michael, Daniel Hoffman, Raif Hyseni, Thilo Reinhardt, Roy Whelden, Vladimir Zenevitch, Janika Vandervelde, and Richard Einhorn. In 2002, Kitka began work on it's most ambitious commissioning project to date: The Rusalka Cycle: Songs Between the Worlds, a new vocal-theater project directed by Ellen Sebastian Chang, with original music by Ukrainian composer and folk singer Mariana Sadovska. Weaving old Slavic mythology together with contemporary themes, The Rusalka Cycle's premiere performances took place to extraordinary public acclaim at Oakland's Malonga Center in November 2005. The Rusalka Cycle was revived in San Francisco in January 2008 and subsequently toured to the Revolutions International Theater Festival in Albuquerque, NM. A European tour of The Rusalka Cycle is slated for April 2009, with performances at major festivals and venues in Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. In February 2009, Kitka will premiere Richard Einhorn's The Origin, a new oratorio co-commissioned by ARTSwego at SUNY Oswego. Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species, The Origin will be scored for Kitka, symphony orchestra and chorus with film projections by award-winning video artist Bill Morrision.\n\nKitka has released ten critically acclaimed recordings, eight on its own Diaphonica label, most recently Sanctuary: A Cathedral Concert (2008). A new recording and companion songbook Cradlesongs, featuring original settings of traditional lullabies of Eastern Europe, is currently in production and slated for release in May 2009. Kitka's first songbook, a companion to the Wintersongs CD, is in its third pressing and continues to make a significant impact on the international choral music field.\n\nA frequent guest on national radio shows, Kitka has been featured on nationally syndicated programs such as PRI's The World, A Prairie Home Companion, All Things Considered, On Point, The Story, West Coast Live and Performance Today. In January 2008, National Geographic produced a World Music Profile Podcast feature on Kitka's Rusalka Cycle project. In recent seasons, live Kitka concerts were also broadcast widely on the CBC (Radio Canada), and Ukrainian national radio and television. Since the winter of 2006-2007, the live performance film Kitka and Davka in Concert: Old and New World Jewish Music has been broadcast nationally on more than 80 public television stations and has been an award-winning selection at international and Jewish film festivals from Beijing to Toronto.\n\nA frequently occurring symbolic word in Balkan women's folksong lyrics, Kitka means \"bouquet\" in Bulgarian and Macedonian.",

The band, which includes Alex Tea (vocals, guitar), Ramsey Norman (drums), Steve Capecci (bass), Ben Guadalupe (percussion), Dave Stolarz (keys), Barami Waspe (tenor sax), Curtis Taylor (trumpet), and Rob Edwards (trombone), has been invited to share the stage with veteran reggae/ska acts including the Pietasters and John Brown's Body.\n\nMuch of Kiwi's pan-global approach to music is inspired by the time that songwriter Alex Tea spent in Brazil, beginning with a trip to the ocean-side city of Fortaleza over a decade ago. It was in Fortaleza that Tea first fell in love with the Portuguese language and capoeira, the Brazilian martial art that combines exuberant dancing and singing with powerful strikes and take-down maneuvers.\n\n\"What drew me into capoiera was the sense of community among everyone involved\" says Tea. \"Each roda [capoeira exhibition/match] had a live soundtrack that featured instruments, melodies, and cadences that I had never heard before, but seemed so familiar.\" It didn't take long for Tea, the grandson of a classical violinist, to incorporate Brazilian rhythms and instruments, as well as Portuguese lyrics, into Kiwi's music.\n\nIn addition to over a hundred club and dancehall performances, Kiwi has also performed at a variety of music festivals and community events in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. They are also proud to be an active and vibrant presence in their home base, the Jersey City arts scene.

He has played extensively with various groups and could be seen in clubs, festivals and on stages throughout the USA and Canada.\n\nAfter focusing on more private studies Koshanin developed an interest in reed instruments and gradually shifted to new directions, now working with several World Music groups performing Latin, African and Mediterranean music styles. He continued recording and performing live and by this time all the accumulated collaborations and side works in both Europe and USA amounted to over 30 albums.\n\nMeanwhile Koshanin found himself returning to his first love in music - piano, and coupled with the revived fascination with Balkan folk music from his childhood, this laid the foundation for a new body of work. By blending the sounds of the Old World with the contemporary Western music, Koshanin transforms piano into a modern-day folk instrument with his unique interpretations of traditional Balkan folk songs and original, folk music inspired compositions.\n\nKoshanin is currently based in Portland, Oregon.

He has since then moved on to detuning and altering pianos and stringed instruments, in order to get them to fit the certain mood and enviroment of his tracks, something which is clearly heard in the soundscape and feel of his music. Recording is a slow process due to the countless hours that go into engineering pianos before recording, but over time a collection begin to take form.\n\nBorn in the Danish countryside in 1978, Kristian grew up with his parents and two sisters, and began early on to show an interest in music. Sharing a interest for New Age and Neo Classical music with his father, he was heavily inspired by the likes of Brian Eno, Philip Glass, La Monte Young, Harold Budd, Pierre Henry and the like, he took an early direction of recording and assembling sounds on tape cassette players and Amiga 500 computer using the recorded sound of everything from rolling pencils to recordings of the one stringed decorative guitar from the wall in his parents bedroom and creating manual multi track recordings by using several tape cassette players wired together while tapping on the needle of a record player with a broken motor, to make a beat. He also began developing an interest in computers and electronics, and the very structure of sound. An interest that grew over the years and started embracing \"real\" instruments and in the process search for the limits of how a given instrument could sound.\n\nAs a musical background, Kristian has spend most of his life composing music in countless genres and subgenres of the electronical music scene, and has released numerous singles, EP's and albums, as well as taken part in various projects over the years.

The L.A. Times has said: \"St. John brings to the stage personal charisma, an unflagging musical imagination and genuine passion. Her two albums to date are bona-fide classics of the violin discography.\"\n\nIn January 2002, Lara released her third CD on her own label. Bach: The Concerto Album and has received enthusiastic reviews. Gramophone Magazine placed the disc in its strongly recommended section, and wrote \"It is difficult to argue with such a technically dazzling and unfailingly musical interpretation.\"\n\nDuring 1999/2000 highlights included engagements with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic, Shanghai Broadcasting Symphony, and Edmonton Symphony, while the 2000/01 season brought her debuts with the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, the Tokyo Symphony (Paavo Jarvi), Hong Kong Philharmonic, Honolulu Symphony, and Calgary Philharmonic, among others. During last season she debuted with the Cincinnati Symphony, Prague Philharmonia, Sao Paulo Symphony, Opera de Marseille and performs numerous other concerto appareances in Canada and the US, as well as recitals at Ravinia, the Miller Theater in New York, in Montreal, Quebec City, and throughout China. Season 2002/03 continues the array of appearances on the recital stage and as soloist with orchestra, among them the symphonies of Portland, Delaware, Knoxville, the Florida Orchestra, and Northwest Sinfonietta. In addition she will undertake a nation-wide recital tour under the auspices of Community Cocerts. Other future engagements include debuts at Tanglewood with the Boston Pops under Keith Lockhart and performances with the Vancouver Symphony, among others.\n\nShe has been victorious in several competitions and in 1997 won the use of the 1702 Lyall Stradivarius for two years from the Canada Council for the Arts and an anonymous donor. Upon hearing her audition, the panel of judges exclaimed, \"Today we have heard one of the great violinists of our time! Inspirational.\" Currently, she performs on the 1779 \"Salabue\" Guadagnini thanks to an anonymous donor and Heinl & Co., Toronto.\n\nLara began playing the violin when she was 2 years old. She first soloed with orchestra at age 5, and made her European debut with the Gulbenkian Orchestra (Lisbon) five years later. She toured Spain, France, Portugal and Hungary at ages 12 and 13, entered the Curtis Institute at 14, and spent her first summer at Marlboro three years later.\n\nUpon her graduation from Curtis, at age 17, Lara took off for Moscow to find out if there was really more to life than just music --- there was. At this time, most teachers at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory (including hers) were indefinitely extending their journeys west, and being without a teacher for the first time gave her the opportunity to travel extensively throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. She also spent two years in England at the Guildhall school, holds a certificate from the Mannes College in New York City, and an Artist's Diploma from the New England Conservatory in Boston. Her teachers over the years have included Linda Cerone, David Takeno, Arnold Steinhardt, Felix Galimir and Joey Corpus.\n\nLara is a great fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, reptiles, and the American Museum of Natural History. She resides in New York City.",

At this point, her research intensified, specializing on ethno-tribal instruments and cultural anthropology. This is when she also started teaching percussion instruments and didgeridoo. She attended the Classical Music Conservatory in Italy, where she studied classical orchestral percussion.\n\nThroughout the next decade in Rome, she authored and performed various pieces of music for theater, dance performances, exhibitions and soundtracks for movies with acclaimed musicians from all over the world. She has also collaborated musically and as a technical assistant to Paolo Buonvino, one of the most famous Italian movie soundtrack composers for almost two years.\n\nCurrently, Laura lives most of the year in Berkeley, CA, where she is creating soundtracks, performances and concerts with West Coast artists of all genres.\n\nIn the past few years, she has discovered the Hang, a new instrument from Switzerland.

Smoke too much. Drink too much. Get your heart broken; maybe even break someone elses. Feel alone until you find a song or a band that speaks to you. Feel less alone when you pick up an instrument and meet others who feel the same. Form a band, rehearse drunk, rehearse straight, laugh a lot, swear constantly, sweat; bond.\n\nA band is like recipe, throw in your ingredients (aka influences) stir and heat up, stand well back and see what comes out.

Love and chill -- like the icy winter winds sweeping across her native island of Gotland in Sweden. \"To be in love is a kind of isolation,\" she says. \"It's not all happiness and joy: there's a lot of pain and emptiness too. But longing is also an incredible feeling, much under-valued today.\"\n\nGrowing up in a poor music-loving family of six children, Lizzi knows all about longing. \"I was lucky,\" Lizzi says. \"I was on friendly terms with the preacher.

It's taken me a long time to find my own voice.\"\n\nIn 1994, she released her first solo album, \"Lizzie,\" for which she wrote most of the songs. \"But that wasn't really me either, even though I believed so at the time.

Besides, I can only sing about things I've experienced - that's when it gets good.\"\n\nThe new album, \"Love and you and I,\" is about uniting opposites -- staying and walking away, sadness and happiness -- and musically uniting the coldness of loops and computers with the warmth of real instruments. \"The album is the story of a love affair -- from the beginning, through all the conflicting emotions to the not necessarily bitter end... Simplicity is the keyword, both musically and lyrically,\" Lizzi says.\n\nThough she left Gotland long ago, the magic island is still in her blood. \"When I sing my lyrics, it's as if I'm back there somehow. It's the same feeling I had when I lived there as a child -- the sunlight flooding sideways at dusk, like a flash of lightning racing through the landscape.\" Somehow, that feeling flows through her songs, too.\n\nUlf Ivarsson plays bass on Lizzi's \"Love and you and I,\" and also has a solo project on Magnatune under the name \"Beat Under Control.\"",

A lone MC commands the crowd's attention as he rips into his first song. The audience is enraptured by LOOT's hypnotizing delivery. A true artist from head to toe, his dedication and drive are overwhelming.\n\nFollowing his dream of being a dynamic talent, LOOT brings a lot more to the table than most of the generic, over commercialized artists currently topping the charts. LOOT's music is powerful enough to transform even the most prejudiced listener into an instant fan. He prides himself on creating songs that have something that speaks to everyone while remaining true to himself and his pure, rap roots.\n\nLOOT grew up as the only child of a single Mom in the military so his residencies and travels in different parts of the world such as South Africa and the Philippines have also influenced his sound. From the inspirational, \"Press On\" to the autobiographical, \"Before My Time\", every record showcases his versatility. LOOT's life has always been interesting to say the least. While living in Japan he developed his rhyme persona and came up with the name \"LOOT\". Crisscrossing the globe has allowed him to fine tune his sound and now he's a force to be reckoned with that can blow any act off the stage and leave all crowds breathless.\n\nLOOT's performance skills can't be denied, he has put in the work cutting his teeth on stages with prestigious artists (Talib Kweli, Little Brother, Kidz In The Hall, Joel Ortiz, Currensy, Big Daddy Kane, 8 Ball and MJG). He has rocked the mic in front of some of the toughest audiences at the legendary Apollo Theatre, Hot 97's Who's Next showcase for new artist at S.O.B.'s, SXSW in Austin, NXNE in Toronto, the Winter Music Conference in Miami and many others.\n\nNow working on his debut project, LOOT and his music continue to evolve. His latest record describes meeting a woman so beautiful that she becomes his, \"Kryptonite\" featuring O'Neal McKnight.\n\nThe music industry is not for the faint of heart and it destroys lives as easily as it turns dreams into reality, but LOOT undoubtedly has what it takes to make it. His enormous talent combined with a stellar personality and fiery passion makes him stand out from all the other new artists. Daring to be different LOOT makes no apologies for making original music.

In addition to this instrumental work, Luke also composes music for film, television and other media.\n\nLuke's music relies heavily on the use of Spanish, nylon-string guitars, the ukulele, guitalele, and the Bolivian Ronroco (a 10 stringed Bolivian mandolin most notably used by Gustavo Santaolalla [Babel, Brokeback Mountain, The Motorcycle Diaries, The Last of Us]). This use of nylon-stringed instruments gives Luke's music a warm, spacious texture which can be dialled up for more passionate Latin tracks, and dimmed down for more reflective tracks.\n\nYou can find out more about Luke on his website.",

    "bio": "After his studies in Holland with J. De Tiege and in Norway with J. Hlinka, Nouwens has been concertising extensively as a soloist and is also a renowned chamber musician. In addition, he has been teaching the piano in his private studio in Norway, where he currently resides.\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the music:\n\nThe main reason for me to record these pieces, is simply because I like them! I like playing them and I like listening to them. The joy of playing this uncomplicated, fun, uplifting music comes very much through in this recording, I think. It was great fun to prepare these pieces, it was thrilling to record them, and still, when I listen to the recording, I get in a very good mood. The recording was done in one afternoon and very much like a concert, without second takes and virtually no editing - I wanted the recording to be as fresh as possible. Although these pieces are thought of as being easy, a lot of them are actually quite challenging like the 4th and the 5th sonatinas by Clementi.\n\nWhile preparing for the recording, I inevitably had to think back to my childhood when I was an aspiring, young piano student. My teacher had me play the sonatinas by Clementi and I got to know these very well. Most of them I liked very much, but not everyone! The worst one was actually the second: I think I had to play it for a long time - maybe too long - before I got it right, because I remember starting to dislike the piece. Some of those feelings might still be there: it was actually the only piece in the recording that needed some editing...\n\nAs a piano student, I never played the sonatinas by the other composers; after Clementi it was straight to the sonatas by Beethoven. Of course, I had heard some of the movements on student concerts, but I was very thankful to get to know them by teaching them myself to my own pupils.\n\nJan Ladislav Dussek (1760-1812), Muzio Clementi (1752-1832) and Friedrich Daniel Rudolf Kuhlau (1786-1832), as they are pictured on the beautiful drawing by the dutch artist G. Ong, lived all in the same period, the early days of the piano and all three had great influence on the music of later pianists. These composers led interesting and often adventurous lives: Clementi was bought by an Englishman from his parents and moved from Italy to London, where he had great artistically and financial succes; Dussek was accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate Catherine the Great from Russia, and had to flee from St. Petersburg; and Kuhlau, who lost his right eye when he was 7-years old, fled to Danmark after Napoleon invaded Germany!\n\nThese composers were also great teachers and wrote a lot of music for educational purposes. One reason why this music is still popular, almost two hundred years later, is because of the high quality of the music. The fast movements are fun to play and to listen to, the slower movements are very beautiful. Even though they are written for children, some of the (especially) slower movements show real depth and could have been used in music for adults.\n\nI hope that you will enjoy listening to this music as much as I enjoyed playing it!",

His humanistic outlook on the relations between the different arts and crafts prompted him to research the interpretation of various lute repertoires, ranging from the 15th to the 18th centuries.\n\nHe has performed, as a lutenist or theorbist, in many baroque ensembles, including La Grande Ecurie et la Chambre du Roy, the Ensemble Baroque de Limoges, Musica Barocca of London, the Ensemble Europeen William Byrd, the Ensemble Baroque de Nice, the Ensemble Stradivaria, La Maitrise de Caen, Akademia, Le Nouvel Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Nancy et de Lorraine, the Orchestre National de Lille, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Marseille, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Liege, the Academie Sainte Cecile, the Ensemble Marin Marais, A Sei voci, and the Ensemble Matheus.\n\nAs a soloist or continuo player, he has taken part in over 50 recordings, some of which have received awards, and has played in concerts in Europe, South America, the United States, China, Africa and Japan. He composed, for the Theatre du Campagnol, the music for l'Impresario de Smyrne by Goldoni, as well as for the Theatre des Amandiers production of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. He also has worked on several historical films for television and the cinema.\n\nYou can find out more about Mauricio on his website.",

    "bio": "Mediva is an outstanding medieval group made up of a flexible number of singers and multi-instrumentalists drawn from the leading exponents in their fields throughout Europe. Concerts feature a mix of exotic medieval and Arabian instruments such as oud, saz, shawms, recorders, harp, psaltery, fiddle and percussion as well as a range of singing techniques to suit each repertoire.\n\nCombining slick playing with unusual visual presentation, Mediva creates an experience that is more than just a concert. Full of verve and dynamism, the enjoyment the musicians have on stage is infectious! In addition to Mediva's fresh approach to music making, concerts are often enhanced with dance, poetry, projections and special lighting as well.\n\nAlthough individual members are steeped in the early music tradition, having trained at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland, Mediva has developed a new way to perform medieval music. Rather than trying to recreate the past, performances use medieval music as inspiration for a new sound world and concert experience, relying heavily on improvisation. The group also experiments with modern composition, specially commissioned for the ensemble and works with funk, rock and world musicians for several cross-over projects.\n\nMediva burst upon the early music scene in October 1998 with an outstanding concert as part of the Radio 3 Early Music Day at the Royal Academy of Music. The group is a frequent guest on Radio 4's 'Loose Ends' and have been featured on Radio 3's 'In Tune' and 'Late Junction' and Early Music Show. They made their international debut in 2001 giving a series of concerts at the Barcelona Early Music Festival and were finalists in the International Young Artists Competition at the York Early Music Festival. They were also invited to be guest artists at the Sommer Kurs fur Musik des Mittelalters at the world renowned Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland.",

    "description": "Pretty pop that sounds like jewel-tone colors",
    "bio": "Merry Ellen Kirk is a poet. Perhaps \"songwriter\" is a more commonly used term, but it's also too commonplace for Merry Ellen's glittering narratives, songs that spring up wildly from her subconscious and bloom into vibrant, lilting melodies. Her sparkling piano refrains sweep and spill into fresh, sweet rivulets of notes; her lyrics weave bright, halcyon tales of dream sequences, the light and dark polarities of the human experience, and beauty in its many forms. \"I write about light and dark a lot... good and evil, dreams and reality, the darker and lighter parts of the human soul,\" she explains.\n\nDespite the undeniable tension in her thematic obsessions, Merry Ellen Kirk explores her dichotomies with grace. She writes songs with the cool effortlessness of youth, sings with the jaunty simplicity and breezy flair of a practiced performer, and plays with fleet fingers and subtle polish. In cultivating her own sound, Merry Ellen has employed a few key elements from her predecessors: the classical prowess of Tori Amos, the natural poise of Sarah McLachlan, the quiet pensiveness of A Fine Frenzy, and the bold whimsy of Regina Spektor.\n\nGrowing up a missionaries' daughter in Mongolia has had its effect on Merry Ellen's music, creating a refreshingly broad perspective from so young a person. \"I think it mostly comes out in my approach to life. I feel like more of my songs are about the world and making the world a better place. My music is about seeing the world and being better for it.\"\n\nOf her unconventional childhood musical inclinations Merry Ellen reveals, \"In Mongolia, they don't have pianos, but I knew it was always something that I wanted to do - play piano. So when we moved back, I started taking lessons.\" They were the tiny seeds of something greater, a glowing catalyst dawning on Merry Ellen's path. \"It was definitely a huge risk to just put myself out there and start doing this full time when I was seventeen. I had only written a couple of songs, but I knew that it was what I wanted to do.\"\n\nA true Nashville singer/songwriter, Merry Ellen works best under pressure, dividing her artistic talents among multiple projects - like serving as half of burgeoning folk duo The Shakespeares and developing a pop venture with fellow songwriter Rachel Pearl - all the while tending her own flowering repertoire. \"I'm inspired by other artists, and sometimes things in nature, too, because God's the artist there. I write songs from those moments.\"\n\nOn her sophomore album, Firefly Garden, 21-year-old Merry Ellen spins a gossamer web of silvery tunes that glints and glistens with morning dew and lightly stroked piano keys. \"Every week for ten weeks I recorded a song, and it was really therapeutic for me. It was freeing,\" she says. \"I think that's what the album is about: all this crazy stuff is happening around you, but it's important to find your inspiration and your beautiful place in life.\"\n\nThe record, produced by Shakespeares counterpart Aaron Krause, is an enchanted glimpse into Merry Ellen's sun-dappled mind, a veritable Eden of lush emerald canopies and richly tinted florets in which her music becomes the soundtrack to a verdant dream like delicate chimes floating on the billows of perfumed zephyrs. Among the high points of Firefly Garden lie the colorful, saccharine lyrics of \"Candy,\" which are a cleverly draped disguise for a faintly melancholy word on chimeras and the hope and sorrow they arouse; the muted, jazzy, rhythmic tune \"Do You?\" that channels a Pieces-of-You-era Jewel or even a dusky Corinne Bailey Rae; the exquisite \"Masquerade,\" an intricate, tortured tribute to Romeo and Juliet that features a rolling, minor piano and a heavy, fragile despair; and \"Clair de Lune,\" a lovely, diaphanous interpretation of Debussy's famous melody complete with Merry Ellen's own lyrics, that swells and ebbs like salty tides breaking lazily on gleaming white sand, a performance both deeply felt and lavishly played.\n\n\"I feel like everything that happens in your life kind of goes into your songs. It's something that becomes part of your music. Who you are is your music.\" Becoming so helplessly entwined with one's music is a silent commitment to see the world through different eyes, an unalterable promise to commit one's life to the glorious immortal verse. That poetry is what sight would be to the blind, speech to the dumb, walking to the crippled, and life to the condemned, but Merry Ellen Kirk sees, speaks, walks, lives, and she has poetry.",

Hanging with monks deep in desert monasteries...\nLiving in the Vatican as a seminarian in his 20's on the way to becoming a priest, yet preferring to play gigs in local Roman pubs, or studying Buddhism in the piazza when he should've been in class...\nnow a seasoned songwriter, performer, father of two babies and four albums.\n\nWhat would a person like this have to say about life? Plenty, especially when magnified through the prism of a song.\n\nMeet Michael Tiernan. Through the experiences of what could be ten lifetimes, Michael is an artist who has plunged into and explored the deep spaces of personal and worldly conflict, the beauty of love and nature, the joy of new life and the pain of losing loved ones, as well as the meaning of suffering and pervasive unhappiness that threatens our human experience on all sides. In his music, he resurfaces from these depths beaming with a positive outlook for all of us.\n\nThe Music\nMichael Tiernan's new album, \"L.A. Can Wait\", is a pop gem. It is Jack Johnson meets Coldplay, Karouac meets Confuscious.\n\nBut why can L.A. wait? Mostly because of a few calls San Diego singer/songwriter Michael Tiernan has received the past couple of years. One went like this: \"Don't worry Mike, I am Strong\". Tiernan hung up the phone and couldn't believe it. Stage 4 cancer, his own brother. 2 years later, as Tiernan was recording tracks in the studio for \"Strong\", the very song he had written about his brother Joe's battle with the terrible disease, he received another call, this time from the hospital. Three days later, his brother had passed away. Tiernan played the song for his brother on the last morning of his life. That song, \"Strong\" is the swirling center of Michael's emotional and inspiring new album, \"LA Can Wait\".\n\nYet \"LA Can Wait\" is not about death, and is certainly not a downer. \"L.A. Can Wait\" is actually an incredibly celebratory album that reveres each unique color in the spectrum of life, from birth to death, with the over-arching mandate to appreciate and enjoy every moment in between.\n\nIn fact, a cancer-survivor himself, Tiernan penned two of the most tender of love songs, inspired by a couple other calls he got, the ones where his wife said, \"I'm pregnant\". These are songs about the unexpected miracle of new life. Tiernan has produced two children since his last album release, \"Spaces\", in 2007.\n\n\"L.A. Can Wait\" is Tiernan's 4th studio album and was produced by L.A.'s rising talent Andre de Santanna, who learned a lot of his production chops from multi-platinum producer, Roy Thomas Baker, and has production and performance credits with an array of top artists including Jason Mraz.\n\nMichael's past three albums are all award-winners (two-time Los Angeles Award winner for Male Singer-Songwriter of the Year and Triple-A Album of the Year, International Acoustic Music Awards Male Artist of the Year Runner-Up, Great American Song Contest finalist).\n\n\"L.A. Can Wait\" is an album for both the goal-driven workaholic and the free-spirited contemplative. It takes you from the beach to the city, from the temple to the tavern, and leaves a little bit of your heart in each place.",

Unique vocals along with her skilled treatment of both improvised and recorded arrangements contribute to her growing reputation as a leading musical talent.\n\nMUSIC BACKGROUND:\nMichelle sang from an early age and became a featured operatic soloist with a Ukrainian troupe based in Sudbury that performed extensively throughout Canada and in countries like Venezuela, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina, where as a teenager she appeared in the role of a gypsy fortuneteller in Zaporozhian Kozaks on the stage of the renowned Colon Theater in Buenos Aires.\n\nShe studied piano with a Conservatory teacher for nine years and regularly participated in the local Kiwanis Festival.\n\nIn high school at Lockerby Composite she played in both the concert and stage bands on keyboards and alto clarinet. As a teenager she performed for two years with a group of elderly gentlemen who formed a mandolin orchestra in the basement of the Ukrainian Hall, and was the concert pianist for the Dnipro Choir and Ukrainian school. She stopped making music at 17. It would be another 16 years before she took up an instrument or sang again.\n\nIn 2002 she began to experiment with sound art, performing as an improvisor with such notables as Mike Hansen and Tomasz Krakowiak, creating a residential music series called the Diogenes Project with prepared guitarist and saz player Arnd Jurgensen.\n\nOn discovering yoga in 1997 she also discovered Indian music and soon her interest in abstraction gave way to world music influences. She studied Indian classical music with Gauri Guha, Sudha and Som Naimpally, and Ed Hanley. A release of studio demos from this period, 'Tellum Passionis,' featuring performances by Ed Hanley, Richard Underhill and George Koller debuted at #5 on campus radio charts. Philly Markowitz gave Michelle her first radio play with a track from this CD on CBC's Roots and Wings.\n\nOne of the tracks from Tellum, 'Call From the Red Bank,' had been especially recorded for her ailing father who, on hearing it, prophesied that her music was a waste of time and would never amount to anything. Ironically, Markowitz chose that very track for airplay, debuting the recording just a few hours after his death. Michelle reflects, \"Rather than viewing that as a vindication of any kind, I understood my father's spirit was speaking to me tenderly, generously and in a way he never could in life. He was telling me through this synchrony to believe in myself and never mind the words and judgements of others, even when those words come from someone you love very much.\"\n\nNear the end of this period Michelle organized a fundraising event for the David Miller campaign at the now defunct Bambu on Queens Quay with the help of the late Richard O'Brien and a host of local musicians including John Farah, DJ MedicineMan (CIUT), Autorickshaw, and Plan-C. She recorded and performed with Nik Beeson, and did a series of shows with BrilliantFish, before retiring a second time to open a restaurant.\n\nIn 2011 she returned to music making with the release of ANIMAL POWERS.\n\nmotto:\ntake your heart / break it like a fruit / red and juicy / see how it shoots",

Signing to Fire Records' subsidiary Roughneck (run by now Domino main-man, Laurence Bell) the Midways set off touring endlessly around the UK and Europe, with the likes of Therapy, Mega City Four, Snuff, Leatherface and Jacobs Mouse.\n\nFollowing their NME single-of-the-week debut \"I Won't Try\", the band recorded a John Peel session in 1991 and released the \"Wish\" EP (including a cover of My Bloody Valentine's \"You Made Me Realise\" - a firm live favourite!) prior to the release of their debut album, Dial Square (1992). The album was made by Sonic Youth producer Don Fleming, and that year saw the band play both Reading and Glastonbury Festivals, among others.\n\nTheir second album, \"Life's Too Long\" was recorded in 1993 and was produced by Leatherface's Frankie Stubbs. Once again the band hit the road, but towards the end of this year Kelly announced his intention to quit the band.\n\nThomson and Konopka auditioned dozens of drummers and replaced Kelly with Brad Aitchison, with whom they recorded a third album. However, something had been lost, BritPop was coming in and the record (and the band!) were shelved. Thomson went on to sign with EMI Music with his band Grouch, (which included Konopka) and it was not until 2000 that Thomson and Kelly resurrected MS, being joined by Russell Lee on bass. A single, the charmingly titled \"Fuck You\" was released in 2001 on the band's own Antipop Records and they continued to play sporadically live in London over the next few years.\n\nIn 2007 they were invited to play the \"4 for Wiz\" gig with Carter USM and The Senseless Things after the Mega City Four singer's tragic death. It was around this time that the recording of a new album was discussed, which finally led to the release of \"Note To Self\" in 2010. The album represented both a return to form AND a leap forward for the band and was greeted by the few in-the-know with warm appreciation after it's release on Boss Tuneage. In November of that year the band made their first trip to Japan and played a successful seven date tour there.\n\n2012 will see the band form their own label Bitter and Twisted Records which will put out a new album \"Always Ends\" and re-release \"Note To Self\" as well as rarities by themselves and associated bands.",

Again, his efforts met with resounding success, both personally and publicly.\n\nMichel and Christian went on to form the experimental acoustic/electro-fusion/jazz/techno/blues-rock band 'Ultraschall', playing on a weekly basis with guest artists from around the world, including Christian Schmidhofer of Embryo.\n\nIn 1999, Jordan and Fey teamed up, under the Sensor II moniker, to produce some new tracks with a more electronic edge, cuts of which rose to the top of the charts on Garageband.com and were included on the Garageband 'Best of Electronica' compilation CD. It was through Garageband that Artemis connected with Jordan to eventually produce the track 'Hypno' on Artemis' latest release 'Gravity'.\n\n'Fata Morgana' is Jordan's latest effort, a sensual trip that beats a path across time and genre, melding the past, present and future sounds of world music.",

    "bio": "Mikal Evans has a folk rock sound of a woman in charge.\n\nAfter a stint with acoustic players, Revival, laying down the keys and violin, she decided to go solo and perform music a little more her own style. Her morose and sultry voice drive her acoustic rock sound, reminiscent of a Tom Waits structure but with sweetly melodious vocals, simultaneously taking influences from the indie rock movement as much as singer/songwriter genres.\n\nFor Evans, influences are dated back to when she was growing up in Moore, South Carolina. That is where she first heard her father record bands in a converted schoolhouse gymnasium (previously owned by the Marshal Tucker Band), and that's where she found music to be her calling. She bought a guitar at 16 and began writing songs immediately, picking up gigs around her hometown and just generally honing in on her craft.\n\nAfter college, she moved to Washington, D.C., signed to Gypsy Eyes Records, and began playing all over the district with Timothy Bracken for months. Before heading into the studio, the duo added the drum work of Jerry Busher (French Toast) and bass stylings of Ashish Vyas (Thievery Corporation). However, this band was unable to tour due to side projects.\n\nAs for her solo efforts, Evans' debuted with an EP, \"A Jailhouse...A Kingdom,\" released June 2008 by D.C. based Gypsy Eyes Records. The tracks are etched with an Appalachian influence and often accompanied by mysterious lyrical content that demands a second listen.\n\nSince her debut release, Evans has been living in New York City where she frequents venues such as the Rockwood Music Hall in the Lower East Side and Spike Hill in Williamsburg. Her first LP \"Build a Cannon\", released February 2012, echoes the southern feel of her first release in songs like \"Holding on to\" and \"Home\", while taking the bite of stronger indie rock influence. Her first attack at producing, \"Build a Cannon\" is laced with those dark guitars tones, haunting lyrics, and an edge we didn't hear in her first release.\n\nThe DCist wrote: \"Evans' style is best summed up by an observation from one audience member: \"This reminds me of a really good P.J Harvey song\". To her credit, Evans has sincerity by the bucket. Like her raspy voice, her melodies seem to prize honesty over prettiness.\"",

Earliest forays into this territory involved nothing more than a borrowed keyboard and a four-track tape machine, but from these humble beginnings eventually came several years of academic study in audio engineering.\n\nThese days Mike is equally at home with a guitar, at the keys of a piano, or behind the controls of a mixing desk, sampler or sequencer. He brings these diverse influences to bear in his music, blending organic sounds and real-world instruments with electronic elements to create compelling melodies, grooves and soundscapes.\n\nAlways a prolific writer of music, he now composes for media, and recently had the thrill of hearing his first short film score played out on the big screen at a prestigious London film festival.\n\nBetween music projects, he is also a sound designer for picture, with a growing portfolio that includes award-winning shorts, web series, and collaborations with film makers from around the world.\n\nYou can hear more of Mike's music on his Soundcloud page.",

    "description": "healing music for planetary transformation",
    "bio": "Mike is a multi-instrumentalist, engineer, and producer committed to personal and planetary transformation. His primary tools are sounds and music. He works closely with healers and therapists of various modalities to create music perfectly designed to meet their needs and the needs of their clients.\n\nMike resides near Seattle with his wife, dearest friend, and co-producer Pam and their feline roommates Nacho, Beany, and Zach. He draws upon the natural beauty of the Northwest for inspiration. He also travels with his portable audio equipment and instruments, recording the sounds of nature, which he sometimes weaves into his healing soundscapes. With eyes, ears, and heart open, Mike is thankful for every day, for sound, and for all of the loving beings that touch his life.\n\nMike's musical journey began in his home town of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Science, electronics, music, and sound were his early passions. His earliest memories are of his father's reel-to-reel tape recorder with its uncanny ability to record and playback sounds and its mysterious glowing \"green eye\" signal indicator. His first word was something like \"ites,\" baby talk for \"lights,\" as he was mesmerized by electric lights. It is not surprising that sound and music are still among his greatest passions 43 years later, and that ambient lighting, lasers, and amateur lighting design are still on his short list.\n\nMike was an overly sensitive kid. \"This hyper-sensitivity is still with of me. Of course I've had to stretch out and deal with many personalities and challenges in my life, but I still find myself empathizing and sensing the feelings and human needs of others. I'm still learning to listen to these instincts.\"\n\nWith troubles at home and a broken family, Mike dropped out of high school for about 6 months. He ultimately obtained his diploma from an alternative education program and, after working for a few years as an electronics technician, obtained his baccalaureate degree in electrical engineering form the University of Oklahoma.\n\nMike found the greatest solace in his music, electronics, and scientific hobbies. For science, Mike thanks his 6th grade Science teacher, Mrs. Burris, his influential uncles, Bill and Johnny, his father, and Carl Sagan. For music, Mike was fortunate to have the great influences of his older siblings. They introduced him to Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Yes, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, etc. The eternally optimistic but enigmatic lyrics of Jon Anderson of Yes were most influential. They painted a sonic world of connectedness and infinite possibilities that is still fundamental to Mike's world view.\n\nMike was first introduced to world music by his father's albums of tribal drumming and steel drum music. Later, Mike was introduced to the world fusion music of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu orchestra by Joel Zane, a family friend and early mentor, and to this day he loves Indian classical music. Mike weaves elements from many styles of healing and spiritual music into his compositions.\n\nMike's mom remains a strong influence in his life. \"She embodies the Golden Rule.\" Together, they attended concerts of John Denver and Johnny cash. Through tough times, they found common ground, great hope, life lessons, and healing in the words and lectures of Dr. Leo Buscaglia. Here was an authority figure, respected by people of all walks, that spoke of the commonality of religions and the common values that give us hope for the future.\n\nMike received his first guitar for Christmas at the age of 15 and bought his first acoustic guitar (with money earned from being a janitor) at age 16. He still owns that acoustic guitar. \"I never stopped playing guitar.\" He has also collected various ethnic instruments over the years and experiments with many music and audio related things. Mike's composition, audio recording, and production skills are entirely self-taught and have evolved over the years. Mike is a constant student of life.\n\nIn 1995 Mike and Pam took a 4 week road trip in his little Honda Civic across the North American Southwest. They had always been drawn to the art and philosophies of the early Americans. They planned their trip around state and national park visits focusing on areas where they could experience petroglyphs, pictographs, rock art, cliff dwellings, kivas, etc.\n\nDuring this trip Mike was exposed to the Native American flute at the Hubbell Trading Post in Arizona. He purchased a primitive 7 hole there and then a 6 hole at Monument Valley later during the same trip. \"I knew nothing about the scales, and with hindsight I now realize that these were really primitive flutes - very difficult to play in tune, etc. Still - I was hooked on this instrument. With the release of my breath it transported me back in time. I now recommend the Native American flute to everyone. It is grounding and links us to nature. It is very approachable. One can make beautiful, relaxing sounds by just following a few simple rules, using their breath, their ears, and their heart. The instrument is wonderfully portable for vacations or nature hikes.\"\n\nJan Michael Looking Wolf has been an important recent influence on Mike in his flute and life journey. \"I embrace the Spirit of One Heart that is at Jan's core. Jan's music and spirit are incredible.\"\n\nOver the last few years Mike has focused on creating healing music. \"I follow my heart and intuition. I start by creating music that will allow me to relax and focus. I ultimately work with a network of wonderful healing practitioners to perfect the music for them and their clients.\"\n\nMore broadly, Mike believes there is deep need for global human and planetary healing. \"Counting my blessings, I am called to open my heart and offer my music to the world. My intention is to create music to enable healing through the power of music and sound.\"",

    "bio": "MonkeyTrial are:\nShaun Bailey: guitars, octave mandola, synthesisers, geometry\nClive Mollart: keyboards, synthesisers, terraforming\n\nIt's difficult to put a date on when MonkeyTrial actually started. We often performed ambient sections while gigging with one our earlier bands in the 1990s, and at some point we decided to take the idea further, calling the project MonkeyTrial (combining part of our previous band's name and the title of a Japanese TV program, in case you wondered).\n\nIn 1998 we completed our first CD, recorded in a local studio during quiet periods. It expanded on our earlier ambient ideas to create an individual brand of soundscapes, electronica and layered guitars. Following that, MonkeyTrial went into a period of hibernation while Clive set up a design company and Shaun started a family. Neither of us stopped writing and recording music, with Clive contributing to ccMixter.org.\n\nRestarting MonkeyTrial, we completed 'un' in January 2010, naming it to possibly represent a fresh start (one), or maybe to represent a prefix to some missing word (the name was chosen as much for its shape as anything else).\n\nOur next project involved the construction of an interactive outdoor sound installation at a RHS exhibition later in the year and was awarded a silver medal as well as drawing hugely positive responses from the people who interacted with our sound garden (see our BBC interview and YouTube video below). We intend to develop these ideas further as a way to present our ambient music in real-time.\n\nShaun Bailey\nI remember taking an audio polyphony test at school, probably around the age of 8, after which I was given the option of learning to play the violin, which I turned down. For several years after that I carried the idea around in my head that I had some kind of musical ability, even though there was little evidence to back that up. An encounter with an electric guitar at the age of 14 changed everything. It was obvious to me that I should play the guitar.\n\nIn the 1980s I moved to Yorkshire to study physics at Leeds University. While there I met some interesting musicians. I transferred what I'd learnt on the guitar to the keyboard in order to use synthesisers, and I became familiar with recording techniques and sequencer programming, becoming continually more interested in textures and soundscapes. A good time was had by all.\n\nAfter that I met Clive Mollart through a mutual friend and bass player, joining their band despite them originally planning it to be an electronic duo (it then added a drummer). The band finally ran out of steam sometime in the 90s, and since then I've mainly worked on music with Clive Mollart as MonkeyTrial.\n\nI use electric and acoustic guitars, a guitar synthesiser (often looped), an octave mandola, keyboards and sequencers. I'm equally comfortable with ambient minimalism, vintage guitar tones and shredded processed noise, depending on the requirements. I'm interested in the immersive, textural and structural aspects of music, and I'm also fairly album-oriented. I like to create collections of music that cover a lot of ground stylistically but also are bound together by some common threads.\n\nClive Mollart\nMy first memory of playing a keyboard was on my parents' foot pedal organ which was eventually chopped up for firewood! I can remember having to concentrate on playing and pumping the bellows with my feet at the same time, which wasn't easy until I was much older. Sadly, with the demise of the organ my playing ability dwindled.\n\nThen several years later I stumbled upon a Yamaha CS5 synth, and the pedal organ memories flooded back. I have since purchased and sold a great many synths, some of them classics that I now wish I'd kept.\n\nI played keyboards with various local rock bands in the 80s and 90s, discovering in the end I was much happier creating music rather than playing in front of a crowd. I retreated to my home studio and worked on material for the first MonkeyTrial CD. At that point I was hooked.\n\nI have also collaborated with various artists on ccMixter.org and release my own music under the pseudonym Planck.\n\nI am inspired by the sonic structures within music, and the use of audio installations in the environment. I've used these techniques to design various audio therapy gardens using my skills as an award winning landscape designer, opening up new opportunities as an installation artist.",

Are those bands great? Yes, they are.\n\nBut now is the age of side projects, and dare I say, \"supergroups\". Them Crooked Vultures and The Dead Weather are both in heavy rotation for me right now.

We say it's rock with no borders. If we decide to get heavy, we do. If an acoustic guitar is around, we'll work with that. If we can convince Tony to write some lyrics, well, then he sings lead. It's just like that.\n\nEver wonder why everyone loves The White Album by the Beatles but (almost) no one puts out a body of work like that anymore? I do. Before you get up in arms, may I say that I would not compare us to the legendary Beatles. But Helter Skelter and Rocky Raccon on the same disc? I like that idea.

As his tastes broadened, however, he began bringing in folk influences such as Nick Drake and Damien Rice, and creating the hypnotic folk-rock for which he is known today. It's this melodic yet mesmerizing sound that Sanders uses to explore issues of spirituality. Although his music expresses a deep yearning for enlightenment, it's Sanders' willingness to examine the eerie, lonely side of this quest that makes his music so powerful.\n\nThough these dark, even spooky influences are definitely felt throughout his work, Sanders' music also contains a deep vein of introspection that keep it from being menacing. One reviewer described the first Mountain Mirrors album, Lunar Ecstasy, as a work \"fit for poets, travelers and seekers,\" while another called it \"the perfect chill-out album with brief touches of Delerium, Alice in Chains, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Portishead and The Tea Party.\" In February 2004, Lunar Ecstasy was named album of the month by both IndieSoundz and StonedGods, and \"Afterlife\" was chosen by Indie Music Beat Magazine for their annual 101 Great New Music Tracks CD.\n\nThe eponymous Mountain Mirrors album is Sanders' second full length album, and shows a deepening mastery of his intense, supernatural sound. Guest musicians include Elad Fish on drums and piano, Claire Fitch on cello, Oren Selas on keyboards, and Guy Bar-Tor on bass. \"They're phenomenal, absolutely sent from heaven,\" says Sanders.\n\nSays The Sound Monitor of Mountain Mirrors, \"From atmospheric sounds to Massive Attack style trip-hop with your more standard acoustic guitar & soft singing tracks.

    "bio": "Mountain Sounds is an international recording project comprised of two songwriters who came together from very different parts of the world to create something new. Franc Castillejos was born and raised in Guatemala, but his path crossed with Tim Hoyt when he moved to Florida to attend school. The pair soon realized they shared a likeminded approach to crafting thoughtful, melancholy pop songs, and they began collaborating while Franc continued his work on a Recording Arts degree at Full Sail University. Their songs eventually took shape in the form of an indie rock band that toured extensively around the Southeast, and they shared the stage with established acts like Band of Horses and Manchester Orchestra while recording and releasing an EP that laid the groundwork for their future collaborations.\n\nUnfortunately, just as their music career was picking up steam, an insurmountable obstacle appeared on the horizon: Franc's graduation. His student visa didn't allow him to stay in the United States after school, and there were surprisingly few work visas available for people who just wanted to play rock and roll. Having exhausted their options, the band was forced to come to a premature end. Franc reluctantly returned to his home in the mountains of Guatemala, where he opened a small recording studio with a focus on developing local talent, while Tim relocated to the indie rock mecca of Portland to pursue a whole new world of musical possibilities. It seemed like a good plan, but his initial optimism faded when he was unable to replicate the effortless creative chemistry he and Franc had shared. Meanwhile, though Franc started strong by releasing an EP of solo material, he eventually lost momentum too, frustrated by the limited scale of his pursuits in the small Central American country he called home. Eager for a fresh start after several fruitless years apart, the two decided to reconvene in Franc's studio, where they began work on something completely new.\n\nThey picked up right where they left off, and the results speak for themselves. Over the course of their creative partnership, Franc and Tim have continually honed and refined their craft, developing a sound that is instantly relatable yet wholly unique. Their songs are rooted in the grand tradition of classic pop music, where a strong melody is always the focal point, and accompaniment serves to highlight, rather than obfuscate, that focus. Their arrangements are sparse but meaningful; every part they play and every sound you hear has been labored over, whittled down, and reworked in the pursuit of a deliberate, untraditional production aesthetic all its own. The resulting songs, bolstered by rich harmonies and layered vocals, are undeniably catchy, yet complex and detailed enough to warrant repeated listens.\n\nThis process of writing and recording may sound daunting, and at times it is. That seems fitting for these two. A musical partnership separated by nations is a huge undertaking, after all. But a good song? For Franc and Tim, that's worth all the stress, all the effort, and all the work in the world.\n\nYou can also read about Mountain Sounds on their website.",

The same people would come together on the project because they enjoyed playing music together. This album grew out of wanting to record the best of what they had done over several seasons, to offer it to their audience and so to help raise funds for the work of Healing Muses.\n\nHausmusik was created to allow Bay Area music lovers to experience chamber music in small, intimate settings, recreating the ambiance in which much 14th-18th Century music was performed at court, in small chapels, or in the drawing rooms of private homes, for family, friends and patrons. Beginning as a series of intimate, informal concerts in Bay Area homes, Hausmusik moved into the parish hall at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Albany, making it a real community concert series the first such series in the city of Albany, for which director Eileen Hadidian received the city's 1992 Citizen of the Year in the Arts award.\n\nOver the years, Hausmusik has helped support local musicians, particularly those interested in trying out new programs and exploring the crossover between early and ethnic music. The concerts, which were held in the St. Alban's parish hall an intimate yet acoustically live room reminiscent of an English manor house presented a varied cast of performers drawn from the wide pool of early music talent in the Bay Area.

Since then he has never stopped exploring the world of music. Experimenting with the sounds he generated using the feed-back of his recorder's microphone and creating ambient recordings with them (without the help of any musical instruments) he went on to discover the world of rhythms trough percussions and drums.\n\nJeremie really found his bliss when synthesizers, sequencers and rhythm machines came to exist. He believes that the emergence of that technology not only gave birth to a new musical genre, but that it also transformed him into the musician he is now.\n\nHis work can be heard on more than a dozen records, as a songwriter, singer, keyboard player, drummer, lyricist, and as a record producer.\n\nToday he divides his time between his family, his business and his home recording studio.\n\n-\n\nAfter a few years studying architecture at University of Montreal and a major motorcycle crash that gave him a new perspective on life, Luc Papineau followed his instinct and started his musical career by co-founding Canada's own \"The Box\" in 1981. What started as a synthesizer and tape machines fiddling frenzy inspired by British prog and German electronic music of the 70's turned into a passion for sound recording and live mixing. After a few years with \"The Box\" scoring major hits on Canadian charts, Luc started a freelance career, mixing radio and TV jingles, recording albums and film soundtracks among which the Academy Awards nominee \"Les Triplettes de Belleville\".\n\nDuring all these years Luc has always seen the studio-computer as the ultimate creation tool, both from a musical and technical point of view. He is still engineering full time from his home-based studio in Montreal while remaining close to his kids...best of both worlds.\n\n-\n\nAlthough Luc and Jeremie went down different paths throughout the years, the connection remained. They met in the 80's and worked together on various musical ventures, and again in 2006, when Jeremie approached Luc for the recording of a French album.\n\nThey worked for a year and discovered they had too many music affinities and that they had to find a way to explore them further. So they started recording one, then a second and a third song only to confirm it was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nFinally it's in 2007 that MUSIC INSIDE was created and a first album \"Outside Forces\" was released followed by a second one, \"Silicon Sandwich\" in 2009.\n\nMUSIC INSIDE combines writing skills with arrangements, programming, performing, producing and recording skills.\n\nMUSIC INSIDE is a unique alloy combining imagination, spontaneity and practical thinking.\n\nMUSIC INSIDE is an association designed to liberate the \"music inside\" while being guided by outside forces.",

This is ensemble playing of great mutual respect and undeniable musicality.\" -Alex Baran, WholeNote Magazine, February 2006\n\nKnown for an inspired synthesis of French and Italian styles, Musica Franca is dedicated to performing the lush compositions written for bassoon and continuo during the baroque period-in particular the work of composers Michel Corrette and Joseph Bodin de Boismortier.\n\nCorrette and Boismortier lived during one of France's most politically turbulent times, but each wrote deeply warm, genial music. Musica Franca easily captures the playful, inventive spirit of Corrette's compositions, with many of the movements displaying the all-or-nothing passion that characterized much of his work. The Boismortier sonatas, by contrast, are treated with infinite subtlety and feline grace-played by Musica Franca with the utmost virtuosity that his work demands. The performances, in fact-with their infinite variations and nuances-reveal the skills that allowed Boismortier to become one of the first composers to succeed without a patron...able to make his living entirely by writing new works of music.\n\nThrough careful selection of the most interesting pieces by these composers, Musica Franca offers a fresh, charismatic perspective on their work. Instrumentation is varied - sometimes even within the same piece - in order to bring out the widest range of tonal colors, and Musica Franca performs the music in the same spirit of pleasure as many musicians of the 18th century: light, nimble interpretations performed with both nuance and joy.\n\nThe founding members of Musica Franca (pictured above left to right) are Mathieu Lussier, basssoon; Nadina Mackie Jackson, bassoon; and Fraser Jackson, contrabassoon.",

The Washington Post noted: \"the effect was transporting - a small miracle of precision and musical electricity.\"\n\nSuch enthusiasm - from both the press and the public - has marked two decades of Musica Pacifica performances, and has won the ensemble an international reputation as early music specialists. Its programs are carefully crafted to showcase the charm, elegance, and diversity of 17th- and 18th-century music, with the core group frequently joined by world renowned guest artists in varying combinations of recorder, oboe, violin, cello/gamba, harpsichord, lute/guitar, voice, additional strings and percussion.\n\nOver the years, Musica Pacifica has brought one inventive, beautifully performed program after another to some of the most prestigious concert series in the U.S., including Music Before 1800 and the Frick Collection (NY), the Getty Museum (Los Angeles), the Cleveland Art Museum, the Pittsburgh Renaissance and Baroque Society, the Seattle Early Music Guild, Early Music Now in Milwaukee, the Houston Early Music Society, the Los Angeles County Museum, the San Diego Early Music Society, and the Cambridge Early Music Society, among many others.

Bach, Vivaldi, Alessandro Scarlatti, Marin Marais, Telemann, Francesco Mancini, as well as Baroque and traditional music from the British Isles - are marked by what Goldberg Magazine (Spain) called \"elegant, stylish, and thankfully unmannered performances.\" They have been lauded in the classical music press, garnering the highest ratings in classical CD magazines and repeatedly being chosen as \"CD of the Month\" by the early music journal Alte Musik Aktuell.\"\n\nMusica Pacifica's 2007 release, \"Fire Beneath My Fingers\", was a featured recording on Minnesota Public Radio, and called \"one of the most exciting Baroque recordings I've heard\" by a reviewer in Audiophile Audition. The Telemann CD was described by Early Music America Magazine as \"superbly elegant...exemplifying the finest in historical performance today,\" and went on to win the Chamber Music America/WQXR Record Award for 2003, honoring the best chamber music recordings of the year. Musica Pacifica's CDs have also won international recognition; the Mancini recording was cited in 2000 as a \"Noteworthy Disc\" at the International Antonio Vivaldi Awards for Italian Early Music in Venice.

With his new project, \"Rockis\" wanted to make a different approach compared to his Dub/Ambient/Experimental project Beatundercontrol.\n\nOn the debut album Red Distortion Ulf Ivarsson who previously has toured and recorded with artists such as Thastrom, Sky High, Bill Laswell, Youth (Killing Joke, The Orb) Tatsuya Yoshida and Hedningarna (The Heathens) moves in a new direction. With repetitive drones, noises and manipulated textures, Noise Hifi redefines the world of Dark Ambient and Industrial Music.\n\nThe title track Red Distortion is a minimalistic pulsating composition based on three different ambient elements. Ships, the second track, contains ambient noises and treated atmospheres with some cutting edge deep bass drones and throbbing analogue synths. Darklands Dub, opens with scary, dark athmospheres before it takes off with a distorted synthezised beat. The composition is built around the energic and sonic boom-dub electric bassline and with its typical \"mute and fade dub\" technique the whole track have a pure dub feel. 21 minutes and 44 seconds long Around the Lake the album's final track is the darkest moment on the album, with different dark mine sounds and arpeggiated analog synthesizers.\n\nFor the Red Distortion sessions \"Rockis\" invited his friend and employer Joakim Thastrom for some Pro One (mono analouge synthesizer) overdubs. \"Rockis\" has played with Thastrom since 2005 and last year produced Thastrom's latest Swedish Grammy Award-winning album Karlek ar for dom.\n\nThastrom is one of the most profilic and best known rock musicians in Scandinavia. He started his career in the celebrated Swedish punk band Ebba Gron (1977-1983) and reached an even bigger audience with the equally influential indie rock band Imperiet (1983-1988). In 1989 Thastrom started his solo career as with his self titled solo album Thastrom. In 1991 he released the follow up: Xplodera mig 2000 (Xplode Me 2000), an album that was extremely computer-based and in 1992 led to the development of the heavy industrial rock band band Peace Love & Pitbulls. Before their break-up in 1997 the band released three studio albums.\n\nThrough the years Thastrom has moved between a number of genres, from punk to rock, electronic music and autobiographical singer-songwriter music. In 1999 Thastrom continued his solo career and have so far recorded 6 successful solo albums that have established him as one of the most important artists in Sweden.\n\nWith the release of Noise HiFi's debut album, both \"Rockis\" and Thastrom continues their mission to break down musical borders, find new paths and create new exiting ways to express themselves.\n\nYou can also check Ulf's second project here on Magnatune, Beat Under Control and more information on his own website or MySpace page.",

Other prevalent themes include those of self-realization and acceptance, as is evident in introspective phrases like 'you've got to know yourself' and 'my hands are clean'.

Kitajima, and Mancinelli continue to present us with a truly fresh, unique sound that remains wildly popular today. Both halves of the duo loved music from their early years.\n\nChris Mancinelli born in Illinois was the son of two classically trained musicians. Though he was a child star in opera and studied classical piano and cello, Mancinelli was enchanted by the sounds of rock and roll. By the time Mancinelli was in junior high, he was jamming with every band he could find in the city's vibrant music scene. He decided to relocate to Boston, Massachusetts and was accepted at the prestigious Berklee College of Music. Following four years of intense musical studies Mancinelli moved to Los Angeles in the early 1980s.\n\nIn LA, Mancinelli worked steadily in the vital local club scene and toured with Blues Goddess Bonnie Bramlett (of Delaney and Bonnie) and Cajun legend Jo-El Sonnier and Garth Hudson of The Band. He formed the highly lauded band BLOC with Nels Cline (of WILCO) and was soon signed to A and M Records. Mancinelli was also recruited to score the music for many visual artist documentaries in collaboration with the Long Beach Museum of Art Video Annex.\n\nOsamu Kitajima was born in Chigasaki Japan. His first musical love was American pop and rock from Elvis to \"The Ventures\". His college band \"The Launchers\" became one of the most successful bands in Japanese music history. In the 1970's Kitajima produced and wrote hundreds of jingles for TV commercials, receiving a Hollywood Radio and TV Award, ACC and a CLIO Award. He then moved moved to London, England and worked with British bands.\n\nKitajima then returned to Japan, and established his original sound through 3 years study of Japanese traditional music. Kitajima relocated to California and was quickly signed to Chris Blackwell's Island Records as a solo artist. He then captured the imagination of Clive Davis and was signed to Arista Records. In the 1980's he moved to CBS/Sony Records and also worked on many TV and film projects as well as working as an independent producer in the US and Japan.\n\nThe duo initiated a partnership in the 1990s producing and arranging the albums of many artists in the Asian markets for Warner Bros, Sony Music, Toshiba-EMI, and Pony Canyon Records. These collaborations lead to signing with the Virgin/CyberOctave label and the ground breaking release of \"Beyond the Circle.\" The guys also found time to create the underground smash Fabulous Breaker Boys techno/surf release which was a #1 seller on the infamous Napster and mp3.com websites. Following this was a project recorded for Miles Copeland's Ark21/mondorhythmica label entitled \"Two Bridges Crossing.\" This music was also featured on the label's acclaimed compilation series \"Zen and the Art of Chilling Vol.2\".\n\n\"Beyond the Circle\" has been lauded for it's combination of the latest electronic sounds with ancient music. Kitajima and Mancinelli fuse the Far East and the Western world in their own inimitable way. They have gifted us with a truly fresh and unique sound that stands the test of time.\n\n\"Christmas through the Gateway\" is an effort to combine the timeless classics of the holiday season with the ancient magic of Asian instrumental and vocal history. The result is a unique connection between the West and the East spanning the primordial to the modern.",

The duo performs generative, improvisational compositions using John Keston's custom software, the GMS (Gestural Music Sequencer), that converts video input into musical phrases.\n\nKeston captures, layers, loops and processes melodic segments in real-time out of the stream of notes created by his gestural input, tailored with probability distribution algorithms. O'Brien accompanies these angular, electronic structures, with dynamic playing that, at times, verges on the chaotic.\n\nJohn Keston is a musician, composer, and sound artist exploring the synesthetic relationships between auditory and optical landscapes. He is also interested in evoking stochastic behaviors in compositional structures by translating visual or gestural input into sound. One example of how John is doing this is with the Gestural Music Sequencer (GMS). The GMS is an application that John developed in Processing.org that analyzes video input and converts it into a sequence of musical information in real-time.\n\nOriginally from the United Kingdom, John is currently based in Minneapolis, Minnesota where he is an instructor in interactive media at the Art Institutes Minnesota. His work involves composition, experimental software development, music and sound art.

Conversation turned to music, as it usually did for these professional musicians, but more specifically the conversation was about jazz and writing original jazz tunes. Steve and Jason had had many conversations about music, but this one had a direction, purpose and an outcome. This conversation was going to result in something. Something neither of them had ever done before. After the coffee was gone and the words had been exchanged, they had a band name, Park St. Trio, and they had a plan... Write original jazz music for people who like good melodies and songs, make an album.\n\nNext step, finding other players. Jason had gone to school with Nick Underwood, so it wasn't too hard to reach out to him, discuss the plan and sign him up. The vibraphone player, Stan Muncy, also went to school at Cal State Hayward, with Nick and Jason. Stan had graduated and spent his time auditioning for symphonies as a classical percussionist. There was a question about whether or not Stan would have the time to play in an original jazz group. But one phone call was all it took. Turns out Stan was looking for something else to occupy his mind and help his music skills along. So the band was formed, Steve Slater, Jason Countryman, Stan Muncy and Nick Underwood. Sure it's 4 people, not 3. I guess that's just jazz for you.\n\nThe songs came together super quick. Steve had written about 10 songs and Jason nearly matched that. The rehearsals began with playing through each tune, then asking which ones were the best for their first album. The title track, \"Goodnight, Daylight\", is a lullaby written for Steve's son. He felt very strongly that this should be the title of the album and everyone agreed. The art work design was done by Steve as well. The picture is of Park St. in Alameda, in 1910. He felt that the music had a classic, old time feel to it. The black and white picture of classic Park St. was a perfect match for the tunes.\n\nThey recorded the album in Fremont CA, at Little Red Wagon Studio's. The actual recording was interesting as well. Most albums these days are recorded digitally into a computer, but the guys in Park St. Trio wanted a more traditional sound, so they recorded to 2\" tape. This meant, no over dubs, no \"fixing\" notes, no redo's. The plan was, 3 takes per song, pick the best one. So that's exactly what they did. 11 songs recorded 3 times each, all in one day. The mastering was then done at Headless Buddha Studio's in Oakland, CA.\n\nI think the outcome speaks for itself. Classic tunes, recorded using a classic method, giving this album the classic feel that defines Park St. Trio.",

He has been a live and session musician (saxophone and clarinet) for most of his life with jazz, rock and blues bands, e.g. Psi Vojaci, Vltava, Milan Svoboda Big Band, Mind the Step, Moimir Papalescu and the Nihilists, Magnetik.\n\nWhile supplying horn lines, solo parts, arrangements and arrangement hints to many bands and projects, the live playing and recording brought him into the studio or onto the stage with a rather incoherent collection of greats like Mike Stern, Alexander Hacke and Bryan Corbett. He is familiar with the underground venues of the communist era, as well as with the big jazz stages like Jazz in Duketown in 's-Hertogenbosch, Prague, Odessa, Sibiu international jazz festivals, and Jazz at the Birmingham Symphony Hall, likewise with the major dance and electronica festivals in his area.\n\nHowever, now he prefers to be more occupied with music teaching and to be home with his family and his modest collection of synthesizers and woodwind instruments to enjoy the possibility of a free choice of forms and sounds when composing his own music from scratch. His compositions and improvisations may sometimes sound quite rough but they can always be taken as soothing musical potions for a human soul irritated by modern life's dilemmas.\n\nAnother dimension is added by Petr's exploration of the capability of music to express abstract views on questions of modern science. His friends once described his music as not exactly the simplest but a quite comprehensive survival guide in modern times.",

    "description": "austere electronica with melancholy vocals",
    "bio": "Philipp Weigl has a wide spread commitment to music. From an early age on he has, as a classically trained pianist, played many recitals in his hometown Freising, Germany. Also, working together with other musicians (for example playing chamber music) has always been a source of joy and inspiration for him.\n\nDuring his teen-years, Philipp developed a strong affection for independent pop and rock music as well as for electronic and ambient music. Playing in various pop/rock bands as a guitarist, keyboarder and bass player has been an inspiring experience for Philipp, helping him to develop a distinct sense of sound and how to use it in music productions. Artists such as Nick Cave, Massive Attack, Portishead, Radiohead and Bjork have been a major inspiration for Philipp at that time.\n\nProfiting from the fast (and now affordable) personal computer development in the 1990's, Philipp could now realize his own ideas and songs by producing them without a whole band. But it took several more years before his debut-EP came out in 2005. What began as a hobby has then become serious.\n\nIn 2005 the austrian netlabel Comatronic put faith in Philipp's music and released a five track EP with his individual style of ambient and idm music, combined with vocals. The EP gained many fans and a lot of lovely reviews in the netlabel-scene.\n\nEncouraged by the success, Philipp kept on working very hard on new songs and was given the oppotunity, later that year, of releasing a second EP on the german netlabel Legoego. Again many positive reactions and reviews in important netlabel magazines and many plays in podcasts and songs being featured on compilations.\n\nThen in early 2006 the big german netlabel Thinner showed interest in releasing a full length album with Philipp. Delighted and a little astonished, for Thinner was widely know as a dub label, Philipp agreed. The success of that (risky) decision proved all critics wrong and lead to thousands of downloads until today. The british newspaper The Guardian wrote:\n\n   \"... Weigl lays his whispered, English-language vocals over lush, dreamlike compositions that drip with yearning melancholy. The results sound something like William Orbit and the Beloved snuggling under the duvet on a particularly dreary winter's morning. Sometimes, it seems, the best things do still come for free.\"\n\nLooking for new goals, Philipp started in early 2007 a project with veteran Jazz and e-Jazz drummer Michael Hoffmann. This highly productive collaboration lead to two releases. Their first EP has been released on the Thinner sisterlabel Autoplate, the second on the well-known id.eology netlabel in Cologne, Germany. A Remix by Stefan \"Gate Zero\" Biermann and lyrics by Charlie Scott contributed to the success of the EP's.\n\nBesides composing and producing music, Philipp loves to play the piano. His special interest applies to the music of the Baroque (esp. Bach, see his recent YouTube video below), the Romantic (Chopin, Schumann) and Modern Jazz (Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea). In his sparetime, he likes to photograph, to read and to go on mountainbike tours. Besides, Philipp is working as a piano teacher in his hometown near Munich, Germany.",

Notes deeper and higher than what a guitar could sound were squeezed into a narrower range and some complexities had to be removed altogether. The arrangements on Too Much Mustard are quite different. If anything they are expansions in many senses of the word. The harmonic overtones shimmer, dance and bass-lines crab and growl in ways impossible with non-digital instruments. These may be late 19th/early 20th century popular tunes, but they use distinctly 21st century instruments. These arrangements were literally painted using special software, not performed. In many ways they are 21st century equivalents of early 20th century player pianos. In many ways Professor Armchair straddles the centuries.\n\nThis music at its best evokes happiness of a by-gone era. Circuses and carousels and calliopes, oh my! To some they may appear to be pandering, even kitsch. But the truth is they reflect the optimism, the innocence and the fun-loving of our great grandparents. They saw the future as a time for opportunity, for hope, for joy. And what could be bad in that? Few could imagine the horrors of two world wars nor fewer still the attacks of the 21st century.\n\nMany of the titles are obscure, yet some achingly familiar. Where have we heard Me-ow before? In grainy old black and white cartoons of mewling alley cats, most likely, but I've been unable to find such a cartoon in my modest collection (and I have copies of all the Betty Boop cartoons).\n\nIs this music whose time has come and gone? Ragtime's popularity has never completely disappeared. And nearly everyone will associate Funeral March of a Marionette with a certain film director with a highly characteristic, bulbous profile.\n\nOther figures of public notoriety associated themselves with these songs. The title tune \"Tres Moutarde\" (Too Much Mustard) was the theme song of early pilot Lincoln Beachey. Beachey hired bands to play it as he looped the loop in his small stunt airplane before paying crowds of amazed onlookers. He felt the song's title Too Much Mustard suited his personality to a \"T.\" He was just a little too much. The arrangements in this collection are perhaps just a bit too much mustard themselves.\n\nIs this music suitable only for children? As they say in the circus: this is music for \"children of all ages.\"\n\nIf you look behind the curtain, you'll find that Professor Armchair is none other than Magnatue artist Glen Bledsoe.",

Psycliq begain producing original recorded music in the early 2000's, but it was The Mathemagican's Riddle, an EP released in 2007, that emerged as the first Psycliq project available to the outside world.

From moody rock to electronic anthems, halt was a chance for the band to spread its wings and show what it was capable of. Less than a year later, Psycliq followed up the success of the electronic rock of halt by going in a completely different direction with Results Not Typical.

His world of sound is a fusion of instruments from different cultures around the world that blend together into something unique and fresh.\n\nHe plays various ethnic flutes, Indian santoor, dholak drum, mridanga drum, and various ethnic percussion. 17 years of rhythm and in last few years strong passion for ethereal sound of flutes result in musical journeys that take us to a place where the earth and the sky meet.\n\nSavitri is a singer very much dedicated to chanting of mantras which are an integral part of her life. Most common words with which listeners describe her singing are: \"Serenity, purity and simplicity, angelic.\"\n\nThey both experience music as highly transformative and think of it is as a powerful medium for connecting with the Divine. They feel that kirtan as a musical and devotional expression is ever evolving and their music is an example of such evolution.",

He later combined his double bass and gamba studies with a masters and Ph.D. in physics.\n\nMeulenbroeks played double bass in the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and gave many recitals and solo concerts in the Netherlands and abroad, including numerous radio and television performances. He also still managed to find time to play in rock, jazz, and pop bands.\n\nFrom 1995 onwards, Ralph Meulenbroeks has specialised in performing early music, studying viola da gamba with Jaap ter Linden. He is now an esteemed soloist in works such as the passions, sonatas, and cantatas of J.S. Bach, and has released several CDs. His previous CD, Voix Humaines with music for viola da gamba solo was proclaimed \"a true monument for the art of gamba playing\" in the Dutch press.\n\nRalph Meulenbroeks played in the Fringe of the Early Music Festival in Utrecht (from 2000 to 2002), in the Early Music Network (2003 and 2004), and his solo recitals have taken him throughout Europe, United States, and China.\n\nOn Moved by Marais, Meulenbroeks plays a six string viola da gamba by Georg Aman (Augsburg), early 18th century on the G minor and G major suites, and a seven string viola da gamba after Michel Colichon (1693) by Reinhard Ossenbrunner (2003) on all other tracks. Meulenbroeks is joined by Pieter-Jan Belder, conductor of Musica Amphion and a gifted player of the harpsichord, clavichord, organ, forte-piano, and recorder.

    "bio": "I first began to work seriously with sound in the mid-seventies. I moved into this medium from the disciplines of painting and printmaking. Sound had the added attraction of unfolding over time.\n\nTime is an important aspect in my work. There are references and connections to time running throughout the body of my work from the first to the last.\n\nEarly influences included Can and Neu, Stockhausen and Cage. These gradually gave way to the music that I was discovering myself which was more in line with Eno and Hassell and extreme experimentalists like Throbbing Gristle and Test Department.\n\nI was a founder member of the band :zoviet*france: who are generally regarded as amongst the pioneers of the post-industrial experimental genre and who have influenced many more mainstream bands in the following years.\n\nMy own work has been noted as having a unique style and individuality and has itself fed back into more mainstream genres in the form of commissioned sample libraries, collaborations and re-mixes, and film and installation work.\n\nAs a continuing practitioner in the visual arts I do not draw a clear distinction between the two mediums. The work in both areas is inter-related and cross-referenced. This is perhaps best illustrated by referring to my earliest releases, which were vinyl LP's encased in a succession of unlikely and impractical \"sleeves\". This served at least two purposes; one being to demonstrate that the \"object\" was equally as important as the music contained in the medium. (These sleeves were all hand-made and hand-printed on a variety of materials including hessian, hardboard, aluminum, roofing-felt, ceramic boxes etc. and have since become collector's items as \"art objects\".)\n\nThe second purpose derived exactly from the \"punk\" ethos of doing it yourself and the \"f*** you\" attitude embodied within punk. (We had been told that it was impossible to make these sleeves in any commercially viable quantity and were determined to prove the critic's wrong.)\n\nThe third purpose, of course, was that it set our releases apart from the norm.\n\nWhenever possible I have carried this practice over into later works and continued to place equal emphasis on the artwork included with a release and the object itself, with CDs encased in specially designed, and often hand-made, packaging. The purpose, once again, is to make something \"special\" and to elevate it beyond the usual defining parameters. Subsequently they have become objects of much greater significance to people than they would have been had they been released in ordinary cardboard sleeves or crystal cases.\n\nThe definition of the genre that I work within is one that is also open to interpretation. I think of my work as \"soundtrack\" music and as such it remains open to the inclusion of whatever style I see as relevant. This also allows me to include narrative occasionally e.g. \"Tin of Drum\" includes narrative pieces written and performed by myself. These owe something to David Lynch and Twin Peaks.\n\nA visit to the real Twin Peaks during an American tour prompted me to later write the pieces which were imaginary spoken statements given to the FBI concerning the whereabouts of the narrators on a date some forty-five years previously. The point being that this would be an almost impossible task, yet all the people \"interviewed\" managed to give accounts of the day in question. It didn't really matter if the stories were true or not, the narrators were all glad to have been asked as it somehow gave some kind of meaning to their lives.\n\nThis is reflected in the statements that they make which include details and insights into their lives, as they judge them to be. In this case these characters (like Becket's) judge their lives as essentially pointless and filled with regret.\n\nThe \"Tin of Drum\" in the title is a reference to my own search for some comfort whilst in a situation that at times seemed pointless and wearisome. In the middle of an exhausting and demanding tour where I missed my family and home my \"happiness\" devolved down to feeding my (then) last remaining addiction - tobacco. After running out of the rolling tobacco that I had brought with me from Europe I had been reduced to buying awful, unsmokeable American blends and was growing more and more agitated and depressed. Then at an unpromising gas stop I wandered into the small store and there alone on the shelf behind the counter was a solitary tin of Drum rolling tobacco. (My all-time favourite.) It suddenly became the Holy Grail of salvation; I could almost see a blazing aura of light around it. My body jumped for joy and once again I was confronted with the question \"what do we seek from life\" and what makes us \"happy\".\n\nWe can search for truth and meaning and enlightenment yet seemingly \"bliss\" can be attained with a hand-rolled cigarette of Dutch tobacco and a cup of Italian espresso.\n\nReflections on the human need to attach some kind of \"meaning\" to life could serve as one definition of what my work is about.",

His love to the off-beat grooves can be definitely recognized in his music, but his desire to experiment with sounds and languages has no borders and is quite difficult to describe, so why don't you just have a listen? ;)\n\nVincent Rateau grew up in Paris where he enjoyed his first musical approach with classical music, playing violin for a period of 12 years. He started developing his individual style, when he moved from France to Germany and started guitar and vocals.\n\nIn a reggae-dub band he has been experimenting with off-beat roots music, mixing languages (English, French, German and Esperanto) and music genres (dub, reggae, irish folk and world music). After 4 years of university, he graduated in linguistics and science of medias, then, finally music got the better of it. By his artist's name \"Ras Tilo\", he started producing his own music. Travels throughout the world definitely added to its original style. You can easily recognize the French and German touch, but also an Irish soul, which he caught working for a recording studio in Galway. La Reunion Island, The Seychelles Islands, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Greece, Great Britain are just a few to name among many others that add to the unique flavour in his work.\n\nConsidering himself neither French nor German, his multi-cultural background can be seen and heard in his music: bringing musicians together, mixing instruments and music genres, remixing, re-remixing and trying to show the beauty of our world's (musical) diversity and the unity in it.\n\nNowadays he is running his own mobile recording studio under GNU/Linux (www.sonejo.net), releasing the produced music mostly under the Creative Commons Licence. Furthermore he is playing and producing music in different side-projects.",

The guitar had only the three treble strings. Still, this was more than enough to work with. \"The first chord I ever learned was a D chord and I think it was because the guitar only had those three strings\".\n\nA Segovia cassette was another inspiration. \"Finding a Segovia album in post-revolution Iran was not at all impossible, however to me it was more than a call to the understanding of the guitar.

I realized that the guitar wasn't the instrument, but that music was, and the guitar was simply a tool for the instrument of Music.\"\n\nUpon arriving to the United States Reza enrolled in Los Angeles Valley College. Throughout his attendance there he held first chair in both the LAVC Guitar Ensemble and the Monarch Guitar Quartet, an extension of the guitar department headed by Robert G. Mayeur. \"Performing (solos) was a great lesson for me.

In fact, it was one of Rob's brothers that introduced him to contemporary piano music. \"It was so different than the music I studied in lessons,\" says Costlow. \"It helped give me the courage to try my own hand at composition. I said to myself 'I can do this!' It was an immediate outlet to express myself and also provide a sense of calm when times were stressful.\"\n\nAt age eleven, Rob lost his mother to ovarian cancer. Even as a young boy, Rob was affected by his mother's constant courage in the face of such adversity. His Mom had and continues to have a huge impact on Rob's life and music.\n\nRob received a Bachelors and Masters degree in Kinesiology from Indiana University, Bloomington (IU). Before transferring to IU as a junior, Rob began his college career as a Piano Performance and Composition major at Ball State University. He then changed majors to Kinesiology as a sophomore, giving an ironic twist to the meaning of Rob's first album, Sophomore Jinx.\n\nAt IU, Rob was hit by a drunk driver and suffered injuries in both hands resulting in a broken left-hand and carpel tunnel syndrome in his right. Through surgery and physical therapy Rob has recovered, but still feels aching in his hands after an especially extensive piano performance.\n\nWhile working on his Masters Degree at IU, Rob unofficially started his own record label based on a business class project. In 2002, Rob released his first professional solo project, Sophomore Jinx (re-released 2005), containing all original music. In 2004, Rob officially founded Tourist Records. Through Tourist Records, Rob continues to create and license music. He hopes to inspire other artists to make their own impact in the world.\n\nProfessionally, Rob has worked for influential New Media companies. It is through the Internet that Rob has connected with many people of different backgrounds and cultures. He has gained fans of all ages worldwide, confirming that people are in need of much more than just your typical \"top 40\" music.\n\nRob admits that he is a perfectionist and from time to time he'll carry on a conversation longer than it should go. Rob loves to travel, \"cut a rug\" when the mood is right, eat pizza and twizzlers, put ketchup on everything, and spend time with his family.\n\nWhile Rob has come a long way since his childhood lessons, his love for creating original compositions is still at the heart of his contemporary piano music. \"Music is what inspires me,\" says Costlow. \"It is in my soul. I never force myself to write. I do it when it comes to me. I take things a day at a time.\"",

    "description": "groundbreaking ambient and dark-ambient",
    "bio": "With over two dozen albums under his belt, Robert Rich has helped define the genres of ambient and dark-ambient music, yet his work remains hard to categorize. Part of his unique sound comes from using home-made acoustic and electronic instruments, as well as microtonal tunings, computer-based signal processing, chaotic systems, and feedback networks. Rich began building his own analog synthesizers in 1976 when he was 13 years old, and he later studied for a year at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).\n\nRich released his first album, Sunyata, in 1982. Most of his subsequent recordings came out in Europe until 1989, when Rich began a string of critically acclaimed releases for Fathom/Hearts of Space, including Rainforest (1989), Gaudi (1991), Propagation (1994) and Seven Veils (1998). His two collaborations with Steve Roach, Strata (1990), and Soma (1992), both charted for several months on Billboard. Other respected collaborations include Stalker (1995 with B. Lustmord), Fissures (1997 with Alio Die) and Outpost (2002 with Ian Boddy.) Rich's contributions to multi-artist compilations have been collected on his solo albums A Troubled Resting Place (1996) and Below Zero (1998). He also records with his group, Amoeba, exploring atmospheric songcraft on their CDs Watchful (1997) and Pivot (2000). Live albums such as Calling Down the Sky (2004) and 3-CD Humidity (2000) document the unique improvised flow of his recent performances.\n\nRich has performed in caves, cathedrals, planetaria, art galleries and concert halls throughout Europe and North America. His all-night \"Sleep Concerts,\" first performed in 1982, became legendary in the San Francisco area. In 1996 he revived his all-night concert format, playing Sleep Concerts for live and radio audiences across the U.S. during a three month tour. In 2001 Rich released the 7 hour DVD Somnium, a studio distillation of the Sleep Concert experience, possibly the longest continuous piece of music ever released.\n\nRich has designed sounds for television and film scores, including the films Pitch Black, Crazy Beautiful, Behind Enemy Lines and others. His musical score graces Yahia Mehamdi's documentary on worker's compensation, Thank You for your Patience. Rich has worked closely with electronic instrument manufacturers, and his sound design fills the preset libraries of Emu's Proteus 3 and Morpheus, Seer Systems' Reality, sampling disks Things that Go Bump in the Night, ACID Loop Library Liquid Planet, and the TimewARP2600 soft-synth by WayOutWare. Rich has written software for composers who work in just intonation, and he helped develop the MIDI microtuning specification, which was accepted as an industry standard. As mastering engineer, he has applied his ear to dozens of albums, and his studio was featured twice in Keyboard Magazine.",

Inspired by the timeless work of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Ani Difranco amongst many others, he colours in his songs about love and life with acoustic guitar, banjo, ukulele, mandolin, piano, double bass, organ, percussion toys and any other instruments he can afford and fit into his little studio.\n\nHis music has been described as 'gently experimental nu-folk' and compared to Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits and Richard Thompson - he is a bit distressed by the misspelling of the word 'new' but doesn't let it distract him from his passion for all things with strings. Robin has released two albums 'Only The Missile' and 'Strangers With Shoes' both receiving excellent reviews in the blogsphere. He is very lucky to have recently acquired a superb backing group and is currently discovering the joys and frustrations of having his own band.\n\nQUOTES\n\"Beautiful songs, the thoughtful Grey sings in a deep English voice that gives his songs a sweeping and poetic quality.\"...Stop Okay Go\n\n\"Grey is one of those wonderful talents that could recite the phone directory on record and you'd still be enthralled. His voice is restrained, yet you can still feel the emotion behind every word. This allows each song to sound light and breezy enough to pull you in at the start, before the emotional punch comes in out of nowhere. Leaving us with the kind of cheerful misery that's perfect for this time of year.\"...Another Form of Relief\n\n\"Bluesy and folky, with enough embellishment to add texture, but which never detracts from the gentle strum of the guitar and raspy, but not growling quality of his voice. It is minimal, but it's not sparse, and it may be a bit DIY, but it's not amateurish, and it may not grab you instantly, but it's a really bloody good album.\"...Song by Toad\n\n\"Robin Grey's songs evoke long dusty road trips, wailing harmonicas and train tracks. The lovely London folk-singer has just released his first LP entitled Only The Missile. If you need walking, moving, or travelling let's-get-this-show-on-the-road music, Robin's folk harem of musical instruments will set you well on your way.\"...The Fabulist\n\nSOUNDS LIKE\nLeonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Richard Thompson, Bob Dylan, Jonny Cash, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, Badly Drawn Boy, Don McLean, John Martyn, Nick Drake & James Taylor\n\nINSPIRED BY\nAni Difranco, Joanna Newsom, R.E.M., Eminem, Kings Of Convience, This Is The Kit, Ruth Theodore, Ani Difranco, Ezio, Joni Mitchell, Carol King, Smashing Pumpkins & Milan Kundera",

Robin Stine's music seduces with a whiff of subtle perfume and a casual graze of her hand as she walks past, leaving the listener powerless to do anything but follow. As a singer, her voice floats on the stylish edge of contemporary cool-light, but never lightweight. As a songwriter, her enchanting originals set her in the upper echelon of today's songwriters.\n\nBorn and raised in Kansas City, Robin began her musical journey as a child singing in school groups and church choirs. When she left for college she had no idea that music would take her around the world. For three of her collegiate years she performed with gospel groups, traveling across the U.S. as well as in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Hong Kong and China. She then moved to Miami in 1996 to begin her graduate studies. During this time she performed with \"Mike Suman's Swing City\" and her own band \"Simply Stellar\" at festivals, hotels and clubs throughout South Florida. In 2003 she moved to Pensacola to focus on the next phase of her musical career-writing and recording her original music.\n\nUnder the guidance of producer Mark Bingham, who's worked with everyone from Dr. John to the Blind Boys of Alabama to the Black Eyed Peas, she's assembled an enviably experienced crew including pianist Warren Bernhardt (Steps Ahead, Jack DeJohnette, Gerry Mulligan), drummer Gary Burke (Joe Jackson, Bob Dylan), trumpeter Steven Bernstein (Roswell Rudd, Medeski Martin & Wood, Don Byron), and her fellow Kansas City native, guitarist Steve Cardenas (Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux, Paul Motian, Mark Isham). A lifelong love of performing inspired by family and further fueled by the completion of her album, have culminated in a desire to return to the touring stage after a rebuilding period in the post-Hurricane Ivan year. Now based in Pensacola, Florida, Robin is ready to follow the release of Daydream with a festival and club scene tour in a way that will also leave the world powerless to do anything but follow.",

In his early twenties, through reading one of his books, he became inspired by the enlightened mystic Osho. He became a part of the Humaniversity in the Netherlands, a breakthrough commune founded by one of Osho's disciples, Swami Anand Veeresh.\n\nSambodhi Prem's name means \"Enlightened Love\". For him it is an everyday reminder that he has been touched by one of the most beautiful, courageous and intelligent human beings that has walked the face of the Earth and a remembering to live and breath that beauty, courage and intelligence in his own life.\n\nAbout his musicianship Sambodhi Prem says: \"When one merges into stillness, when musical notes turn into waves of knowing and sounds are stirred and sent away on journeys through the air - to create music like that - a pureness of heart is required. I set out on a journey to face myself and to learn the scope of my own being. Beautiful music has to come from a beautiful place in yourself. At a young age I decided to discover that place.\" \"I like to create music to disappear into, to let sounds become silence, so that the listener, alone at night in a mellow room, can have a glimpse of the divine. \"\n\nMusic has been a thread running through Sambodhi Prem's life that joined parts that were fragmented and merged together polarities that appeared disparitive. \"When energy starts to bubble up from nowhere, heed its call. Go with the overflow and let yourself be part of precious things, follow your bliss, but don't ignore your agony,\" he adds.\n\nTogether with his partner Sandipa, an accomplished painter, he has written a book about the challenges of staying well in the modern day: \"The All And Everything Of Healthy Living\".\n\n   Artwork credit Sandipa - As Earth Forms: The Pearl\n   \n\"Celebration is my religion, love is my message, silence is my truth.\" - Osho\n   \nSambodhi Prem lives together with Ma Deva Sandipa in Mount Franklin, Victoria, Australia, where the sounds of his studio resonate with the abundance of nature...golden leaves fall on the surface of a lily pond.\n   \nYou can find out more about Sambodhi on his website.",

Jeff had just listened to Sean play a set of guitar-based soundscapes and asked him if he'd like to try doing the same with voice added. The two went back on stage and proceeded to stun the audience and themselves with vocal melodies floating on, and entwining with, gossamer clouds of looped and layered electric guitar.\n\n10+ years later, they are still weaving dreamy, haunting melodies with atmospheric soundscapes.\n\nBoth musicians have been playing committedly since their late teens. Both bring playing and listening to left-of-center rock and chamber music to this meeting place of spiritual, ethereal sounds - which is not the contradiction it may seem at first, as the willingness to experiment and explore is a foundation of each.\n\nThe music Jeff Sampson and Sean Carroll create is lush and minimal; melodic and drone-like; pastoral and edgey. It places a travel mat in the minds of listeners, coaxing them to go wherever one's thoughts need take them - wherever their emotional state need be. Over the years, the duo has explored sonic and emotional territory that falls under many different \"spirits\" - from aboriginal to eastern orthodox, from caverns to lofty peaks, from breeze-filled summer fields to close encounters with introspection.\n\nSampson-Carroll's music says many different things to many different people.

As he moved in and out of rock bands through his formative years, his desire for record engineering began.\n\n\"It was an average brownstone on an average street in Hamilton (Ont. Canada), but every musician in the city knew about the amazing records that were recorded there.\"\n\nAfter obtaining a Bachelors Degree, Sandeep took residency as a studio engineer at Grant Avenue Studio, the famed recording facility built by Bob and Daniel Lanois. He spent two years listening, learning and recording some of the best musicians in the world including Gordon Lightfoot, Ani DiFranco, Bruce Cockburn, Daniel Lanois, Sarah Harmer.\n\n\"By chance, my music came across the desk of an influential TV producer, and that's how composing for television began.\"\n\nThrough the mid-nineties, Sandeep wrote music for several national and international television shows including Fashion Television, FlashForward, and Departures. During this period he continued to play live music with local musicians throughout Canada.\n\n\"I was completely transfixed by British bands that put their own spin on American hip-hop and electronic music. Also, home studio technology was developing quickly and much of the innovative electronic music was coming from independent artists on small labels.\"\n\nThe bands coming from places like Bristol, England influenced his own music and the sounds of the Asian Underground helped shape his musical sensibilities. Creating textures from sounds manipulated through digital processing equipment, and layering those ideas with live instruments was the basis for a new approach to writing and recording. With each release, his music was sought after for TV and Film licensing.\n\n\"I had composed quite a bit of music for them, so Music Supervisor seemed like a natural progression\"\n\nBy 2011, Sandeep was music supervising TV shows in Canada and continues to write and license his own tracks for a myriad of media projects.",

His knowledge of the major works of the classics, and his professional repertoire is of the highest caliber. What puts him head and shoulders above many other pianists, however, is his expressiveness and originality of emotion with which he performs piano pieces of the classical vein. His performances of certain concertos by Mozart and Beethoven are some of the finest of these works that have ever been recorded. His ability to convey the most subtle of nuances in these pieces is what separates him from the merely good pianist performing today. The originality of his interpretation put him in an internationally select class\"\n- Mr. Tamal Gal, Music Director and Conductor of MAV Symphony Orchestra, and Professor at Liszt Music Academy.\n\nPerforming publicly since the age of ten, Sebastian studied with Maestro Aldo Antognazzi, a former pupil of Arturo Benedetti Michelangelli, who was a descendant of Franz Liszt. He participated in master classes in Hungary at the Liszt Academy of Budapest, and lived for long periods of time in The Netherlands, where he regularly performed at the world-famous Concertgebouw Hall.\n\nAt \"Sala Verdi\" in Milan (Italy), he gave a solo recital which included the works of Liszt, Mozart and Prokofiev. Antonio Mormone, President and Artistic Director of the \"Fondazione La Societa Di Concerti\" and organizer of the event, said: \"he is one of a handful of truly great pianists today. His touch is commanding but subtle at the same time. He can express the most adventuresome and bold statements, but he is also capable of performing the most intricate and delicate passages in classical music. For example, in a concert he gave here at our hall, his work ranged from the jagged and wild rhythms of Liszt's Mephisto Waltz, to the staid, stately and majestic tones of Prokofiev Sonata n.7. He played flawlessly.\".\n\nHis extraordinary emotional intelligence and \"highest level of musicianship\" ... not only make him \"flawless in technique, sense of rhythm and tempo, but most significantly, his originality in interpretation is absolutely wonderful\"\n- (S.Spreng, Miami Herald) but has allowed him as well to shine high with many different genres, and specially when performing and breathing the music of his beloved Godfather, with whom he spent summer holidays in Punta del Este, the extraordinary and revolutionary Astor Piazzolla.\n\nSebastian is the founding member of the \"Astor Piazzolla Foundation Trio\", with which he toured Belgium, The Netherlands, U.S.A. and Argentina, and recorded the \"Nacar Concerto\" with the Argentinian Mayo Chamber Orchestra. Astor was of great influence in his career and beginnings, from helping him choosing his first piano at a very early age, to empowering his talents with guidance and nurturing.\n\nBeethoven and Piazzolla live inside Sebastian with grand mastery and passion, as well as his extraordinary educational activity with the goal of bringing the musical universe of children out, teaching them, at an early age, the unlimited possibilities of self-expression through music. He is Faculty at the Piano School of New York City since 2005, and lives with his wife and seven-year old son.\n\nIn 2009 Sebastian Forster ventured into accomplishing a lifetime-legacy major project of immense proportions: the recording of The 32 Complete Piano Sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, in an ongoing creative effort conceptually started three years ago. He will be recording the ongoing work of Beethoven through ten albums, during 2009, 2010 and possibly 2011.\n\nSebastian is a true Beethovenian, he breathes and experiences Beethoven's every single emotion, of true love, drama, passion, desperation, beauty and darkness. Living Beethoven with every key stroke is an experience of monumental inner impact, only at reach for the daring soul and the truly talented soloist. This is a great opportunity to hear Beethoven as it was never heard before, getting lost in the world of invigorating ideas and emotional virtuosity that has made Sebastian Forster one of the outstanding interpreters of the classical repertoire currently working on the world stage today.",

These five music junkies have a wealth of experience as songwriters and performers, and their enthusiasm and professionalism come across both in their recordings as well as their explosive live shows.\n\nThe New Record\nChange Is The Only Constant is Seconds Before's most accomplished and complete work to date. The album rocks with a confidence that comes with years of experience and features songs that you just might not be able to get out of your head (in the good way, not the annoying way).\n\nChange Is The Only Constant might as well be the motto of the current decade, and there's no question the sound of this band has evolved over their nine-year existence. Sure, the trademark twin guitar interplay is still there, along with soaring vocal harmonies and one of the hardest hitting rhythm sections around, but on this record there's a definite sense of the unexpected.\n\nInspired by the highs and lows of life in their hometown (including a sincere reflection on the heroes and victims of the 35W bridge collapse in \"Calling Home\"), the album represents the band's most mature and honest songwriting to date.\n\nThere's no pretense to any artificial rock star fantasy here. This is rock about real life performed by five working guys who haven't forgotten the simple joy of turning amps up loud and singing at the top of their lungs. So give the newest Seconds Before album a spin or nine, but don't get too comfortable, because change is... well, you know.\n\nA Brief History\nSeconds Before was incorporated in the amazing year 1999, and have successfully weathered turnover in the ever-critical vocalist slot not once but twice. Vocalist Brian Larson has been with the band since 2002 and made his debut on the band's 2003 full-length Further Destinations (on iTunes), which has received national college and satellite radio airplay and strong reviews. The band's history reaches back even further into the early 90's as many of the band members played in seminal Minneapolis hardcore and rock acts, including Threadbare, Downside, Bloodline, 108, Picturesque. With years of collective touring, writing, and performing experience under their belt, Seconds Before has become a precision rock machine.\n\nQuotes\n\"Complex power-pop with excellent guitar work and melodies and a tight as hell rhythm section.

    "bio": "My name is Shawn Harris and I have been playing guitar for about 20 years - I started when I was 1 ;) Not really - yes I feel old saying that.\n\nI was in many heavy bands in the 80's; nothing I am too proud of but out of that came a great love of music and especially of songwriting. I found that although I loved the intensity of the 80's heavy music I really loved the songwriting of the 70's. So I played in bands for a few more years writing all original material and playing out wherever I could. As bands almost always do we all got \"Real Jobs\" and families and kind of let music go away. The guitar went under the guest bedroom bed and I gave up my dream for a few years.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I found an old recording of my drummer Mike Payne and I playing some acoustic stuff and I remembered how much I loved doing acoustic songs and thought hey I should try to write an album of mostly acoustic stuff. So I called up Jay Stanley the old guitar player from Matchbox 20 and hired him as my engineer and went in to his studio and cut 9 songs from 2 old songs that I had and the rest new material that I wrote for the cd or from pieces of music I had been working with. Out of this came the cd titled \"Temptation.\"\n\nI did all the guitar without a drummer and just used a click track - man was that hard:) So then I hired Chris Smith a session drummer to come in and play over what I had recorded - not an easy task. He was great and I think he really shined. I sang all the parts and then Jay played bass on Memories and Fortune Lies Freedom. I did not have anyone to play bass on the other songs so I played bass and then decided to give keyboards a try. So I played keyboards on every song except Sundown. Bryan Clark played on that song and MAN he rocked it.\n\nA few of the songs have done really well. Keeping Hope Alive was named the top 16th song of 2007 by kick radio and Promised Land was all the way up to 11 on the American Idol Underground website and number 11 on Artist Underground.\n\nPlease enjoy the music and I really appreciate any feedback you have :)\n\nThe cd was Titled \"Temptation\" so I decided to kind of go with the semi religious tone but I am not really a Christian artist - just a guy who wants his songs to have some meaning and thought behind the lyrics.\n\nTake Care and enjoy life - no one gets out alive - but the memories of us live on if we do it right ....",

For many years the musicians of Skarazula have developed a growing interest for ancient music and have furthered their research to enhance their love about this fascinating and rich universe. The many shapes that the medieval era has left us to discover inspire the choice of instruments on which the group plays. Furthermore, the luthier of the group crafted nearly all the stringed instruments that he plays and the percussionist also built some of his own. From traditional to original music, the three minstrels of Skarazula put in their music the same passion and the same talent.\n\nSkarazula was created in Montreal in 1999 by composer, string player, singer and luthier Francois Rainville with percussionist and backup singer Steve Grenier. Flutist Francois Perron joined the group in 2001 after a change of personnel, he also sings back vocals.\n\nThe group's approach is inspired by the many ways musicians of today have of playing medieval music. The musicians of Skarazula do not try to achieve a historical reconstruction; they rather let themselves be inspired by what has been discovered about the history of music. Combining this with an obvious freedom concerning arrangements, what the listener gets is a style somewhat modern but yet remaining true to its medieval essence.\n\nIn addition to the original pieces, Skarazula's repertoire comes from Europe and the Near East between the IXth and the XVIth century. The composer of the group, having furthered his knowledge of oriental music, brings an authentic colour to Skarazula's music. The three musician's approach brings a very rich blend of mixed skills. It shows in the arrangements and the playing techniques used. The medieval modes and harmony are respected, but the Europeans probably did not know some of the instruments used like the djembe. In that sense, Skarazula's approach is not for the purist as the group allows itself a great freedom.",

These efforts proved highly successful and the debut album The Secret Life of Angels was released in September 2002. The album made its debut at Jodrell Bank Planetarium that month and the audience reaction was very positive and enthusiastic. After quickly gaining a number of excellent reviews and a great deal of airplay around the world, SkinMechanix continues.\n\nLive concerts are now a regular feature. So far, SkinMechanix have performed at three concerts in the Awakenings series, two as the headline act.

Note: Magnatune artist Tim Rayborn is a member of the Solace Live project, and Charlie Pecot of Falik performs on some of the Solace CDs.\n\nJeremiah M. Soto describes his musical endeavors \"Solace,\" meaning comfort. Born November 4th 1968, in Loma Linda California, to Ismael and Erlinda Soto; Jeremiah's first experience with music was sitting silently near his sisters bedroom door curiously listening to The Beatles' Sergeant Peppers... or David Bowies Low. Ever since that early experience, Jeremiah showed an interest in music - especially drums.\n\nAfter teaching himself basic piano technique, Jeremiah started writing music at the age of 14. In 1990, he began formal studies in Music Theory and Piano at Crafton Hills College, and graduated with an Associate of Arts degree in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, he and lifetime musical partner Dann Torres formed the group Eventide. They recruited the talents of Laura Grissom on bass and Julie Blodgett on vocals. Influenced by bands like Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, and various classical composers, Eventide experimented with fusing Medieval and Middle Eastern music. In the process, Jeremiah realized his fascination and talent for Middle Eastern drum rhythms. To better his knowledge, Jeremiah attended classes in Frame Drum, Conga, and African polyrhythms by world-renowned percussionist Ronnie Engle. Unfortunately, after several releases on various compilations and countless live performances, Eventide disbanded in February 1995.\n\nIn November of 1995, after attending countless Middle Eastern Dance conventions and parties, Jeremiah felt inspired and confident enough to release his debut recording Rhythm Of The Dance (eve 01) and Solace was born. At the same time, Jeremiah resurrected the old name Eventide to serve as a foundation name for his independent record label, now known as Eventide Music Productions.\n\nIn the early part of 1996, Jeremiah reunited with old pals Dann Torres and Laura Grissom to collaborate on a short lived side project, Still. Their efforts were directed to record a CD themed at combining minimal guitar with Middle Eastern rhythms. In mid 1996, Thinnerweb (eve 02) became the second release on Eventide Music Productions.\n\nSoon after the release of Thinnerweb, Jeremiah started work on his second Solace release. In August of 1997 Sha'waza (eve 03) came in to the world; catapulting Jeremiah's music and popularity to the forefront of the Middle-Eastern Dance Music genre. In 1998, Sha'waza was nominated for a IAMED Award for best Belly Dancing music.\n\nHot on the heels of the Sha'waza nomination, Jeremiah began work on his next endeavor. The Gathering Season (eve 04) was released in late 1998. Soon after completion of The Gathering Season, Jeremiah was introduced to master dumbek player Souhail Kaspar. From that point on, Jeremiah's fascination and skill with Arabic drumming became more refined, as he embraced the Classical Arabic Style. In addition to accompanying Souhail at parties, Jeremiah has performed with the UCLA Mid East Ensemble, and as a back up percussionist for Souhail for Sinbad, a European released CGI movie.\n\nIn June 1999, Jeremiah returned to the studio to explore the vast new knowledge of rhythm arrangements taught to him by his new mentor and friend, Souhail Kaspar. With the help of Harry Saroyan, Alex Spurkel, Lydia Fortner, Jim Karagozian, Dann Torres, Steven Flynn, and the troup Yogini Kundalini; Jeremiah was able to produce one of his best works to date, Ahsas (eve 05). The project would not have been complete without the help of Ansuya's contribution to the CD cover, giving Ahsas its signature beauty. Released on March 24th, Ahsas' debut at Rakkasah 2000 and was an instant success that promised to out sell Sha'waza.\n\nJeremiah hopes to break the confines of typical Middle Eastern Dance Music & inspire others through his unique compositional style and love of Arabic rhythms and music. Solace music is not just great belly dancing music; it is a journey into the heart and mind, a journey where others fear to tread.",

This experience made me realize how we human beings relate to nature. We are made in our bodies to be inhabitants of planet Earth, we are biological beings, dependent on Earth's ecology. Nothing can replace our natural environment as our life support system. Nature is also a source of deep emotions and a feeling of connectiveness to the elements that are often overlooked today.\n\nThe destruction of nature for profitability. Our collective alienation before the powers of money and politics. I am playing the soundtrack against that desolation. There's always that little hope, that flower in the middle of the asphalt. Watch the forces of nature still growing in places, still going strong within ourselves. My music is all about that contrast. I imagine the landscapes of the past and the future in a surreal voyage. Then I make the sounds...\n\nThis solo project started in fall 2004 and Soleil Vert produced his first album in 2005.

    "bio": "A few years ago Sophia Marie aka Wicked Wench was an obese single mother living on welfare in California. With a history of drugs and promiscuity, her future did not look bright.\n\nThe early death of her mother in 2004 from obesity complications could have added to Sophia's problems, but instead she used the event as a wake up call and decided to change her life.\n\nToday, Sophia Marie is 50kg (110lbs) lighter and setting her new home of Sydney Australia on fire with her ballsy hard rock music.\n\nSophia Marie grew up in a musical family, playing flute and piccolo in school bands. She switched to playing bass guitar when her dentist made her wear braces but soon gave that up too when a jealous boyfriend objected. It was over a decade later before she picked up the bass again.\n\nCompletely self taught on the bass, once Sophia picked up the instrument again she found herself making up her own riffs and soon after, adding melodies and lyrics to her compositions. She then recruited a band, started performing gigs and a new rock star was born. Her new partner was so impressed by the quality of Sophia's music that he decided to sell his house and invest the money into making Sophia's debut album!\n\nSophia Marie's debut album \"Twisted\" pulls no punches. Describing herself as a cross between Madonna and Metallica, Sophia seamlessly blends soft and hard into an exotic mix of musical emotion. Unashamedly sexual in nature Sophia says she sees the hard rock music as a male stimulant to her powerful, soaring vocals, which she says, are a natural female reaction to good loving done right!\n\nSophia's music video for Voodoo from her album \"Twisted\"\n\nThe Twisted album is structured around the theme of love and loss, the songs carefully arranged to create a loose story or old style concept album. The power and intensity of the songs in the centre of the album suggest Sophia Marie has drawn on some personal experiences to create songs that should drive deep into the all but the coldest of harts. The cheeky and sometimes downright sinful content of the rest of the songs suggest her previous out of control lifestyle has not been entirely forgotten!",

    "description": "Lushly evocative songstress singing music for a new world",
    "bio": "With a uniquely ancient-to-modern sound, Canadian singer-songwriter, Sora weaves together contemporary styling with the mystical moods of Celtic folk, New age, medieval madrigals and other modes of early music. The result is a heady, colourfully evocative tapestry that conjures the imagery of long ago but feels just as current as anything from the present musical landscape - all while sounding like little else on today's airwaves. With a penchant for threading stories and narratives through her live performance of swirling harp, earthy percussion, ethereal backups and soaring vocals, this much is clear; you have never heard anything quite like Sora.\n\nBorn and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Sora was classically trained on violin and piano as a child and toured with a youth orchestra and fiddling group when she was a teenager. Surprisingly, however, it's only recently that she became a singer, shortly after the birth of her first daughter in 2000 (she and her husband have four children). \"I'd been away from music for years, and I was starting to feel like something was missing in my life,\" recalls the vocalist, who majored in psychology at the University of Calgary and graduated with honours. \"I started taking voice lessons as something just for me, and things just blossomed from there.\"\n\nThe initial fruits of Sora's newfound voice were 2003's Winds of Change, a collection of traditional folk songs from the British Isles, and 2007's Light, a four-track EP. In 2009, Sora released a full length album of original compositions, Heartwood, in which Sora delves deeply into examinations of human archetypes, all held within a contemporary framework. With this release, Sora received airplay on many college and community radio stations, charting on several while the reviews poured in, unanimously applauding her crystalline voice and unusual lyrical vision within the songs. While her love of mythology plays a central role in her songs, Sora maintains that for her it's not simply about setting tales to music. \"It's always my goal to understand the heart of the myth, rather than to simply retell a story,\" she says. \"I'm far more interested in discovering why that myth is still meaningful today.\" And like those ancient myths themselves, the songs Sora sings have a hauntingly elusive resonance that will surely see them echoing throughout the ages to come.\n\nSora's uncanny sensitivity to meaning within stories and her ability maintain urban relevancy within the organic settings of her music is starting to garner recognition. In 2010, Sora was commissioned to give voice to Calgary Family Service's 100 year anniversary, which became the song, Legacy, recorded with Juno-nominated producer, Douglas Romanow and performed at the gala event. \"My ultimate goal is to create something that people would want to listen to and get lost in,\"\n\nPraise for Sora\n\n\"Sora's sweet voice, potency of lyric and attention to musical detail captivated me. It made me want to hear more after the very first song. I was never disappointed.\"\nR J Lannan: Zone Music Reporter\n\n\"Few albums can be described as perfect, but this one definitely deserves that distinction. Sora takes her listeners to a magical place when she sings, one that few if any will want to leave.\"\nMossip\n\n\"Some musicians are performers and some are true artists. It seems clear from every detail of \"Heartwood\" that Sora belongs in the latter cateogory.\"\nCatherine L.Tully: Celtic mp3 Music Magazine",

Drawing inspiration from sources as varied as 60's soundtracks, 70s kraut-rock, 80s post-punk, and 90's electronica, Sound of Seventy Three brings all this together with a pop-like sense of melody and a lush, almost classical, sense of orchestration.\n\nStarting out in Doug's bedroom in 2005, Sound of Seventy Three became a live band for several years playing loud instrumental guitar-based post-rock in Atlanta area before eventually returning to the bedrooom in 2010 to focus on writing and recording. While playing live Doug perfected writing for his rock ensemble of two guitars, bass and drums and this is still the starting point for much of Sound of Seventy Three's music and arrangements.

    "bio": "The Spoons song \"Nova Heart\" placed at number 46 in The Chart Magazine's cover story on the 50 Best Canadian Songs Of All Time (chosen by 1,600 major music industry players across the country). Nova Heart places at number 169 on CFNY-FM's 1002 Best Songs Of All Time chart. Nova Heart places at number 459 on The Mix 99.9 FM's Best 500 Songs Of The Century countdown. The Spoons album Arias & Symphonies is named as one of the 20 Most Influential Albums Of The 80s by The Chart magazine. Not bad for a bunch of kids from Burlington, Ontario.\n\nFormed in 1980, from the heart of suburbia in Burlington, Ontario, Gordon Deppe and Sandy Horne would soon make Spoons a different kind of household word. Their unique brand of upbeat, danceable music quickly became anthems to legions of fans. Gold albums, various EPs and a movie soundtrack produced such hit songs as Nova Heart, Arias & Symphonies, Old Emotions, Tell No Lies and Romantic Traffic. Now, more than two decades later, who could have predicted the magnitude of a phenomenon known as \"retro 80s\", when old and new fans alike would rediscover these Canadian classics?\n\nFrom the dance club to the symphony stage, a double vinyl set of four remixes of Nova Heart became available to clubs and deejays internationally and the Spoons found themselves performing their hits with a full symphony orchestra. Most recently, a Live In Concert DVD was released by Much More Music/Linus Entertainment, their songs appeared on a 20th Century Masters double CD (Universal Music) and a new, long awaited album has finally hit the streets. Aptly entitled \"Unexpected Guest At A Cancelled Party\", the album is packed with previously unreleased recordings and concert favourites from the vintage 1982 - 1985 years.\n\n\"Searching for and finding these songs was like uncovering lost memories in some ancient, overgrown garden. Some had to be carefully restored from their neglected, corrupted state, not unlike faded photographs or cracked, moss covered statues. For some, it seemed, it was merely a matter of time before any hope of a second life would slip away altogether. But with a bit of care, they were brought back to life and, as they did, the memories that surrounded the songs also came back into focus. Of innocent days in the early 1980s when we were at our creative best and songs came without effort, when they just happened out of the sheer pleasure of making music.\n\nIf you push back the vines a little, you might see bits and pieces of songs that would make their way into other recordings. Unpremeditated Love and In The Hands Of Money show you their origins and, I think, are still more pure and musical. See if you can pick out the references to the Arias & Symphonies album, scattered all through 2000 Years. The earliest compositions on this collection are Bending and the instrumental Young English Gentleman, the latter a tribute to our good friend and producer John Punter. Given the chance, I think newer songs like Love Drum and Love Can Be A Stranger could have had their day in the sun. But more than any, Spaces was probably buried the deepest, so much so that I didn't recognize it as our own when I first found it. So long had it been sleeping under the dead leaves. The instrumental section near the end is my favourite moment on the whole album.\n\nMost of these songs were recorded after Romantic Traffic and Tell No Lies, in a tiny, hidden away studio in Oakville, Ontario. We were about to embark on a whole new chapter in our musical lives that would leave these old ideas forgotten, to slowly weather over time and eventually fade into the earth.\n\nSo, in a way, this album truly was almost never made. Fortunately, never is just a word.\"\n\nListen to Spoons ... again, or for the first time ... and join in the retro 80s fun.\n\nFor more information about the Spoons please visit their website.",

    "description": "huge ambient compositions.",
    "bio": "It all started with a shoebox and rubber bands....\n\nBorn the son of an electronics industry father, Bobby DeVito was exposed to the wonders of computers and electronics at an early age. His parents noticed a certain musical bent when they discovered the young child placing rubber bands on a shoebox in tonal order. Soon the budding musician received a guitar for his birthday.\n\nDuring the early days of his youth, Bobby often accompanied his father to work, marveling at the rooms full of mainframe computers at Control Data. He and his father were electronics hobbyists as well, building a digitally controlled television with remote control in 1976. At this time, Bobby got his hands on his first synthesizer - an Arp Axxe. Running this basic monosynth through an MXR delay and flanger opened new worlds of sonic discovery. Nevertheless, the guitar proved the be his main instrument for many years, with Bobby touring the USA with new wave pioneers The X-Statics. DeVito was able to fulfill his synthesizer jones during these years by toying with lead vocalist/keyboardist Jon Allmightey's analog synths during rehearsals and soundchecks. After seven years of constant touring and performance, the band split up and Bobby headed to South Florida for an unknown musical future.\n\nGathering together a drum machine, 4 track recorded, and some signal processing gear, Bobby recorded his first album \"Guitar Salad\" during this era. This album was more successful than anything he had done previously, being featured on mainstream radio stations all over Florida and garnering a fair amount of press attention. This project set Bobby upon the solo artist path that he has pursued ever since. It was also during this time that academia beckoned, and DeVito managed to get into the prestigious IDS program at St. Petersburg Junior College. After graduating from SPJC, he set his sights on the progressive honors university New College in Sarasota Florida. After making it through the gauntlet of admissions tests and interviews, DeVito was accepted and began to work intensely with Professor Steven Miles, the director of the music program for the college. Miles was a huge influence on the budding electronic music composer, exposing Bobby to a world of sounds, textures, sociological theory, and music history. It was also beneficial that New College had just built an electronic music studio the year DeVito started his studies, as well as hiring an electronic music professor from the Eastman School of Music, Robert Constable. The electronic odyssey had begun. At New College Bobby was exposed to the music and compositional thoughts of composers such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, and Iannis Xenakis, as well as philosophers of music such as Walter Benjamin, Simon Frith, and Theodor Adorno. This learning experience helped DeVito to develop his compositional skills and theories, as well as gather an appreciation of electronic music history and conceptual framework.\n\nDuring these halcyon college days, DeVito managed to secure a job working for BMG Distribution as their College Marketing Rep, a position he held for three years that allowed him to get \"real-world\" experience in the music industry. At New College, each student must write a Master's Thesis in order to graduate, and Bobby decided on an ambitious project -- to combine his written thesis with a full length album of ambient music. Starting with Erik Satie, and ending up with modern day composers such as Aphex Twin, DeVito's thesis covers the dawn and progression of ambient music, the ways ambient music is distinguished from Muzak, and the sociological implications of ambient music listener reception by touching on the theories of philosopher Theodor Adorno. DeVito's thesis lives on in Hyperreal's \"Epsilon Ambient Music Archive\".\n\nThe CD portion of his thesis is entitled LVX Nova. This project was a collaboration between DeVito and noted electronic composer Mike Meengs. The thesis project was a success, and DeVito graduated from New College in 1996.\n\nAfter graduation, DeVito set out to get the project released commercially. After releasing the album independently and garnering over 60 pages of press worldwide, three labels presented offers to release the album: R & S Records in Belgium, Subharmonic Records in NYC, and MIRAMAR Records in Seattle. After entertaining all the offers, DeVito decided to sign with MIRAMAR, home to one of his biggest influences Tangerine Dream, and also a part of the BMG Distribution family. LVX Nova received tons of press, critical accolades, and made it to several \"top ten releases\" lists. In addition, the CD won several awards, including the 1999 \"JAMMY\" award in Florida for best electronic act.\n\nHowever, with the instability of MIRAMAR after motion picture company UNAPIX bought out the label in 1999, DeVito was again without a label. After doing some international touring with Atlantic/Code Blue recording artist Sherman Robertson (as bandleader and second guitarist) DeVito once again plunged into the electronic abyss. Stargarden was born at this time. The name stargarden is directly influenced by the underwater life of starfish, who can form huge colonies on the sea floors in a communal form -- sadly, unlike their human counterparts.\n\nHoled up in a loft in Hyde Park Tampa, and later Miami Florida, DeVito creates music entirely for the sake of the process and the enjoyment of his fans. Relying on timbre, repetition, and space, the music of stargarden ranges from drifting ambient space music to beat driven electronica. Bobby cites other artists such as Tangerine Dream, Aphex Twin, Brian Eno, Global Communication, Peter Namlook and FAX artists, John Cage as influences on his particular brand of ambient music. After discovering the then-fledgling MP3.com from his friend. sometime musical partner, and influence Mike Meengs, DeVito placed the first stargarden album on MP3.com, and received thousands and thousand of downloads, as well as quite a few CD sales.\n\nNow, in order to bring electronic music distribution to a new level, DeVito has signed stargarden with Magnatune, believing in their new model of music distribution and intellectual property management. And with new music being released only here on Magnatune, the future of stargarden ambient music is secure.\n\nIf you like this music, please consider buying a CD or two to help the process continue. The quest for ambient beauty continues.....",

Their core repertoire is of the Classical Era, with occasional performances and recordings of Baroque and Early Romantic Music.\n\nTheir interpretations on original and replica instruments enrich the standard Classical piano trio repertory, bringing the listener to the spirit of the original sonorities. \"They deliver resonant, buoyant readings, with the sound of the elusive fortepiano captured as well as I've ever heard it.\" --The SF Examiner.\n\nSince 1985, the ensemble has toured many years on the California Arts Council Rooster and in the USA, as well as winning grants to festivals in Germany, and France. Numerous concerts have included guest artists, ranging from vocalists and instrumentalists, to a Spanish dancer.\n\nThe prominent musicians heard on the Streicher Trio recordings include Katherine Kyme and Carla Moore, violin; Sarah Freiberg, cello; Charlene Brendler, fortepiano; and Judith Nelson, Soprano. \"The Trio's interpretation is dynamic, with a lot of lyrical movement, and persuasively profound.\"--The Diapason, France.\n\nBios:\n\nKatherine Kyme is a principal violinist and soloist with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and with the American Bach Soloists. She performs Classical era chamber music with the New Esterhazy Quartet as well as the Streicher Trio. In addition to advocating contemporary music, she conducts two youth orchestras connected with the California Youth Symphony. She studied violin at UC Berkeley, Yale University, and in Vienna.\n\nCharlene Brendler, founder of the Streicher Trio, performs on and teaches both fortepiano and harpsichord.

    "description": "a one man analogue ambient orchestra",
    "bio": "It's easy to understand why this forty-something Northamptonshire based Glaswegian has such maturity in his compositions. That is, if you already know of his decade-spanning career in music, and its reach into so many aspects of said business.\n\nBut for those who don't, let's provide a simple summary...\n\nStuart Sweeney the performer surfaced in the late 1980s. A technically talented player, he was lucky enough to work alongside the likes of Eddy 'Knock On Wood' Floyd. Later, work in specialist music retail involved inviting Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith, and Steve White (Paul Weller's drummer) to jam in-store. And then there are also numerous songwriting credits, film, television and advert work, not to mention performances with the South Bank Centre's London Philarmonia.\n\nSo by now you appreciate there's depth, diversity and experience. Which means it makes sense there's such depth and experience evident in the results of his solo project. The fact that, prior to this, Sweeney has scarcely ventured past the point of fandom when it comes to symphony hall soundtracks, makes it all the more impressive. As does the time he spends, MiniDisc Recorder in hand, scouring the surrounding landscape for appealing, interesting, and often abstract noises, thus widening the scope of this aural vision.\n\nWhen Oomff Records was set up, this passion and dedication to a life surrounded by notation paper was finally cemented, as was an outlet for Sweeney's own work, realised by a brave move to self release.\n\nThe decision to engineer his first long-player is mirrored in the welding course he took, with the aim of being able to produce his own percussion instruments. In short, it's a DIY ethic rare in a many professionals, though evident in the greatest musicians of our time.\n\nMade his own way, in his own time, the debut, 16:9, is a spellbinding collection, and the product of some 16 months in the studio. Mastered by Denis Blackham, the Master of Masterers whose career name-checks The Who, Jimi Hendrix and Kraftwerk to name but a few, those first 12 tracks from contemporary-classical's newest beacon of light reflected this analogy. The opening strings ushered in some glorious sunrise, and from there on in, we were given a soundscape littered with fascinating details, like the days that account for Sweeney's last three decades. A film soundtrack, played by an orchestra of one, it's only when people can see from both sides that they achieve something so complete.",

While I continued to listen to music by Henry Mancini, Andre Kostelanetz and Percy Faith, Michael Jackson on the one hand, and our great Indian film composers, S D Burman, R D Burman, Salil Chowdhary and others on the other hand, my musical tastes grew wide ranging and deeply rewarding. In my teens I would write poems, set them to music in my head. To do so better, I took up guitar classes as well.\n\nI had an opportunity to watch while famous film composer Vijayabhaskar was at work and he told me \"Why not be my assistant, you have very good ears!\"\n\nThat's when I took up composing seriously. Then came the journey with musical software and I was delighted to see how much I could put together and then to sing or play the veena on the track was really the peak of musical happiness for me!\"\n\nSuchitra Lata, classical veena player, has trained under illustrious veena teachers like, Neela Roy (Kalyanakrishna Bhagavathar school), Rajeshwari Padmanabhan (Karaikudi school) and continues to learn with Maestro Chitravina Ravikiran.\n\nAs a composer/lyricist, she writes in English, Tamil and sometimes in French.

    "bio": "Sun Palace is the musical vision of vocalist, songwriter, and musician Andriette Redmann, who was raised on a Wisconsin cherry farm that doubled as an artist colony-a place she describes as \"a combination of Ringling Brothers and a Bergman film.\" Andriette came from a musical family going back many generations and her earliest inspiration was her aunt, Frances Martinsek, a popular accordianist of the 1930's and 40's.\n\n\"Aunt Fran had me singing in front of audiences at the age of four in her cast-off silk and satin gowns,\" says Reddman. \"I loved her stories about playing for the Milwaukee Braves, the Green Bay Packers, and the German Chancellor.\"\n\nAs adulthood approached, Andriette launched herself into world travel and musical exploration, learning about jazz at Berklee College of Music, classical at Hunter College, and punk, electro-pop, and Bulgarian folk singing in New York City.\n\nSoon after her arrival in New York, Andriette landed a recording contract with CBS Italia Records. \"Performing in Itay was an absolutely 'Felliniesque' experience,\" she says. My band and I were appearing on Italian TV, playing in the popular 'FestivalBar,' and hanging out with the Italian rock stars. The wine, the food, the song-every moment was chaotic and surreal!\"\n\nThen tragedy struck, her parents passing away within two years of each other, and Andriette considers her time spent caring for them precious. \"Nothing can prepare you for the extreme feelings of losing both your parents,\" she says, \"especially when it happens when you're so young. I felt I was looking down over the sharp edge of the world and gazing into a black, bottomless abyss.\" Grief-stricken, Andriette continued to search for meaning through music and various esoteric studies in psychology and bodywork, finding inspiration through the pursuit of sacred Hawaiian Hula dancing.\n\nThe spirit genrated by Andriette's quest also led to the creation of Sun Palace, and its debut CD, Into Heaven, which featured ten songs dealing with death, life and the reflection of beauty that comes from both. With co-producer and guitarist John Rokosny (Smithereens/Carry Nation) onboard, along with lead guitarist Tony Geballe (DGM artist/Trey Gunn Band/Toyah/theatrical composer), Sun Palace began to enjoy national attention. The song \"Into Heaven\" was featured in the soundtrack of the film, Indian Fish, and the song \"Your Hands Lie Open\" appeared in national ad campaign. Songs from Into Heaven went into heavy rotation on XM Satellite Radio, and all Borders bookstores showcased the disc as well.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Palace announced the release of its critically acclaimed new album, Give Me a Perfect World: a delicately buoyant work of lush, layered folk-rock that Andriette lovingly dedicated it to her late brother and gifted musician, John Redmann, who appears on the recording, along with sister Marise Redmann. The record also features an illustrious lineup of major league recording industry veterans, including legendary drummer and percussionist Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel/Paul McCartney/Elvis Costello), Smithereens frontman Pat DiNizio, cellist Jane Scarpantoni (Springsteen/Lou Reed/REM), and drummer Mark Brotter (HEM).\n\nSays Andrietti: \"Give Me A Perfect World is ready for the world.\"",

We are 4 musicians who have experienced deep training in a variety of very traditional music forms (including western traditions), from renowned and insightful teachers. We each bring musical ideas and experience from all over the world: India, Bali, Brazil, Europe (Eastern and Western), America and use rock, jazz, classical and contemporary creative music.\n\nWe have tried to channel that training, that exposure into what we hope is an organic expression, one that incorporates what we have learned from our wonderful teachers into a unique music. We are acoustic. There are no electric instruments on this recording, no synthesizers; nothing against them! It's just not what we bring to our musical experience. All of our music incorporates improvisation - some pieces are almost completely improvised, others have an 'open' section for spontaneous exploration. As closely as possible, this recording represents the way we really play.\n\nDavid Trasoff - sarode\nHas studied sarode performance under Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, India's 'Living National Treasure,' since 1973. Acclaimed for his performance in both the United States and India, David has appeared in concert in arts centers, universities, conservatories and festivals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. He served as Director of the Indian Music Ensemble at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has taught at the California Institute of the Arts and Pomona College. David has composed and performed music for film, theater and dance projects, including an award-winning Los Angeles production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the acclaimed Indian art film Leela.\n\nRobert Jacobson - guitar\nA guitarist, composer, and improviser based in Los Angeles, holds degrees in guitar performance from USC and the California Institute of the Arts. He has studied under the direction of Scott Tennant, Miroslav Tadic, Vinny Golia, Pat Kelly, Joe Diorio, and Frank Potenza. His music reflects his training in classical guitar, jazz, free improvisation, and Balinese gamelan. He was featured soloist on the soundtrack to \"What Matters Most\". In 2004 he released a CD of original compositions titled Coldwater on his new record label, Banana Bread Records.\n\nJohn Graves - bass\nHas studied composition with Boulanger pupil Joel Feigin, classical bass with Nico Abondolo. and North Indian classical music with David Trasoff and at the Ali Akbar Khan College of Music. In 1998 John moved back to his native Los Angeles where he delved more deeply into jazz improvisation with Harold Land, Billy Higgins, Roberto Miranda and Kenny Burrell. John has worked as a composer, bassist and producer in such diverse areas as pop, Arabic, gospel, hip-hop, Western swing, film music and reggae.\n\nRandy Gloss - tabla and percussion\nA founding member of the renowned percussion group Hands On'Semble, has performed throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia.

Comprised of ten tracks, the album delivers melodic, yet hard rock, each song the soundtrack to a fictitious horror movie.\n\nMade up of Scott Chapin (vocals, guitar, bass, and keyboards), Paul Becker (guitar), Kevin Ellis (keyboards), and Cheo Larcombe (drums), Sweet Teen Killing Machine make guitar-rock that is as frightening as it is heart pounding.\n\nFrom the supernatural horror of album opener, \"Curse of the Bloodwolf\" and the album's first single, \"City of the Shrieking Dead.\" To the more human terror of \"Virgin White\" and \"New Meat,\" Sweet Teen Killing Machine can only be described as the sound of an insane rock beast that always seem to be chasing you.\n\nA concept, more so than a band, Sweet Teen Killing Machine are redefining the concept of a band, preferring to create music rather than rehearse it, in essence a studio project more so than a live act. Matter of fact, before their debut has even been released, the band has already almost entirely written, though not recorded, the sophomore follow-up. That doesn't take anything away from the debut, though.\n\nWith redefining the concept of a band comes a different approach to writing music. Ideally, Sweet Teen Killing Machine wants to create soundtracks to movies; so, while writing soundtracks to fictitious movies, they take a scenario, a scene from a movie they've made up in their heads, and create the ideal soundtrack for it.\n\nOriginally a basement project between friends, jamming and having a good time, Sweet Teen Killing Machine's debut grew out of that. Never meant to release a record, the ten tracks that compile the album came out sounding so powerful; the members of the band couldn't help but release it.\n\nWith one live show planned for a CD release and the elusive possibility of more - if the band feels so inclined - Sweet Teen Killing Machine is as unpredictable as the horror movie patrons they write sounds for.\n\nBut, they wouldn't have it any other way. With the predictability of rock 'n' roll these days, Sweet Teen Killing Machine throws out tradition - and just makes music for themselves. All the while, those that hear their debut full-length will take notice and go, \"more please.\" Again, like the victims and villains in the horror movies they write soundtracks for.",

With electronica becoming a more dominant force outside of the clubs and underground hip circles, SynchDub is building a sub genre that's been called rhythmic ambientalism, conjuring up transcendental sounds that make the body and spirit move. That innovation has earned SynchDub the envious distinction of the \"Heart and Soul of Electro.\" For years, she was a percussionist with a variety of artists in her native Belgium.\n\nIn late 2006, SynchDub released its first album, the playfully titled Drone, which caught the progressive ears of DJs and Internet radio with its signature sound-style. Utilizing varied and rich electronic methods such as Leftfield, BreakBeats, and Computer Beeps, SynchDub's sound runs the gamut from exuberantly bright to emotionally deep and dark. While aimed more towards the dance floor, the record was what SynchDub calls \"an introverted affair,\" allowing the external sound to immerse the inner emotions.\n\nNoted for putting a human face on electro, SynchDub is also influenced by the Eastern culture of modern Japan, where electronic music is considered an extension of the body. That fusing of mind, soul and body is the hallmark of SynchDub's musical mission.\n\n\"Cutting and recycling again can give a totally new/other vision for me.

Then add a bong hit or two... That just BEGINS to tell the story...\n\nHold on to your hats because the roller coaster is going off the tracks... Michael Trapp, a.k.a. Mike E.T., a.k.a. The Alien, a.k.a. Captain Freak is a \"serious musician.\" For whatever absurd reason - this label has had almost evil overtones in the 90's and even into the new millennium.\n\nHe has attended Mannes College of Music in Manhattan and graduated Berklee College of Music in Boston. For those 4 years he focused exclusively on practicing and writing music. After graduation he played in some heavy progressive chops bands in N.Y.C. and L.A. such as Danse Macabre, DreamSpeak, The Fringe and Dreamer. All broke up due to internal differences just as they were getting press and an audience. Fed up with bands in general he became a hired gun, becoming the 2nd guitarist in Eddie Ojeda's (Twisted Sister) band.\n\nHe bought his own crappy studio and recorded \"The Furious Guitar\" demo which was featured in a Guitar Player's magazine piece. In the 90's Mike met his dream vocalist Matt Wells. He joined Matt's band Bad Habit - a pure power pop outfit with heavy arena rock overtones; then came Nirvana and the band disintegrated after being offered a minor record deal. In retrospect Mike E.T. is thankful Bad Habit never made it. Nirvana opened up a whole new can of worms man, and that was right after hearing Nine Inch Nails for the first time. \"I was never gonna be the same person.\" Matt and Mike then went on to record an album for there own selfish purposes and Bliss(This)' \"Chasing the Mad Rabbit\" was born. Unfortunately for Bliss(This), just as positive reviews and feedback were heading the bands way, Michael's ex-wife was stricken with a serious illness and the music had to be put on hold. During that time, he wrote and demoed the entire \"Captain Freak\" album.\n\nWith Mike's ex-wife's illness finally in check he bought a new studio and started recording. But then Matt's wife became pregnant and Mike was pushed into handling all the vocal and instrumental duties. \"F*** it,\" said Trapp, \"I'll change the name of the band to CrimsonFaced and take over the f***ing world anyway.\" During this dark period of his life Mike also re-wrote and re-arranged and added new songs to \"The Furious Guitar\" - A 13-song instrumental guitar CD that is one part genius/one part insanity. Fans of over the top guitar playing and amazing instrumental melodies will be FLOORED. It was also during this period that Mike met the beautiful and talented Cash Casia; he was hired for some NYC showcases and recorded on her demo currently being shopped to major labels.\n\nIn 2005, Mike E.T. now of CrimsonFaced released the stunning \"Captain Freak\" CD. 13 songs of rock and roll majesty, a tapestry of rock's powerful take no prisoners history. Bored of all the nameless faceless rock of the new decade the Alien gave music's boring landscape a serious kick in the ass. And now in 2009 OMFG can it be can it be? The long awaited follow up to \"Captain Freak\" is FINALLY HERE! WTF was Mike E.T. doing over these last 4 years? Geez, you would think a musician that locks himself up in his Sober Sucks Studios would come out once and a while to play - but not Mike E.T. The Alien was lovingly caressing his guitar strings in the most god awful perverted way.\n\nHis poor keyboard was banged and hammered from one end of the studio to the other. Between writing music for a futuristic CGI movie still in development and adding some cool tunes to a soon to be filmed PORNO (hehe, I said porno ;-))) Mike E.T., between psychotherapy sessions with his mixer/therapist Paul Kurzweil, wrote and recorded 18 songs, 13 of which come together on the deliciously demented and aptly titled \"Lunatic Binge.\" Whereas \"Captain Freak\" was mostly in your face the entire CD, \"Lunatic Binge\" veers from sick rock and roll to melodic musings about life. Think Trent Reznor meets the Bee Gees; after a drug binge. Think Pink Floyd for the 21st Century. Think Ozzy and a sequencer doing battle for each others' soul.\n\nMike E.T. hopes you enjoy his creation. He poked his head out of his studio to give the world Lunatic Binge, and now he has once again crawled into his studio, locked the door, put a huge dresser against the door, and has imprisoned himself with 50 cases of Corona, 5 bottles of Patron, 5 guitars and 12 Virgins. See you in 2 or 3 years...\n\nBrief Mike E.T. Interview\n\nDo you play live ?\nNot at this time. If there is a demand for it I will hire a band and get to it. I am a very spiritual and whacked out of my head performer. The stage is a whole different ballgame than the studio. I feel like an uncaged wild animal when I perform... been known to have sex with my guitar on stage!\n\nHow, do you think, does the internet (or mp3's) change the music industry?\nThe internet is the single greatest thing for the musician.... EVER!!!! F*** the record companies and their endless stream of sound-alike bands. F*** the no talent pretty boys and girls who saturate MTV. I care about the songs. If they are great you have my attention. Anything less and I'll pass.\n\nWould you sign a record contract with a major label?\nI highly doubt it. It would have to be on my terms... and I doubt that would be o.k. with any label.",

We play without a conductor, and with forces that are as small as possible (mostly single strings and single voices). A genuine spirit of enquiry and reassessment pervades all aspects of our performance.\n\nFounded in 1996 by Nicolette Moonen, we established a series of programmes of Bach cantatas in St John's Wood Parish Church in London. There we began to introduce some of these lesser-known works to a wider audience. As a result of this we have been invited to play all over Britain and have built up a faithful following. In 2007 we launched a new series from St John's Downshire Hill, in Hampstead.\n\nOur programmes now focus on themes that connect music from different parts of Europe in our period. Bach is there in some, but not all our concerts, and is often related to other composers of his times. We are also developing links between programmes, over several years. In 2008 we recorded and issued the first of a series of CDs based on these concerts.\n\n\"... simply the best rendering I have heard, soloists ideally matched, and constituting a full and sufficient demonstration of the rightness of one-voice-per-part.

Joe then worked with Klaus and his recordings to create the final mixes, capturing a simple modern music with a vintage and nostalgic sound.\n\nThe music of The Bell Hours is an eclectic and sentimental take on modern Rock and Roll, taking lyrical themes from more modern times and ideas with our impressions of love, compassion, and mindfulness (not to mention anger and jealousy) and combined it with musical themes stretching from Folk, Rock and Roll, Indie, Hip Hop, and Jazz, culminating in a rich pop music experience with amazing replay value. The group of talented musicians inspired by the music that came together to tour the album have done an astounding job in translating the dynamics and moods live that the album captured in its recordings.\n\nThe Bell Hours debut album is only the tip of the iceberg for Songwriter Klaus Larson, and a further exploration into unique arrangements and possibilities is yet to come. A new six song EP is scheduled to be released on September of 2014.\n\nYou can find out more about the Bell Hours on their FaceBook page.",

    "name": "The Bots",
    "description": "the world's first virtual band",
    "bio": "The Bots illustrate a future where artists, actors, performers and all sorts of media figures will be not human, but sophisticated human-like simulations. That this will happen is a simple issue of economics. As artificial personality simulations become more effective, entertainment conglomerates will find human \"creatives\" and \"stars\" to be increasingly irrelevant, replaceable, and disposable.\n\nUnrecognized, low wage human creative labor will toil behind the scenes to bring you \"stars\" who are nothing more than 3d models and speech synthesizers. This was predicted by science fiction author Norman Spinrad in the classic book, \"Little Heroes.\" The Bots are Spinrad's fantasy come to life. Nowadays, most of the examples we have are in the videogame industry, where voice actors are usually synced to the animated 3d models because of the difficulties of creating acceptable results from the current crop of speech synthesizers. But that's a technical problem, one which The Bots have already solved.\n\nThis is all rather revolutionary in the context of musical entertainment, but The Bots have an unexpected agenda.\n\nAnticipating a future where media corporations will use this technology to consolidate their exploitation of the creative classes, The Bots are staking out this territory first. We are here as entertainment, a warning of what is to come, and a vehicle for casting a suspicious eye on the powerful.\n\nMost importantly, The Bots are here to demonstrate entertainment technology as a force for good, a force for freedom, rather than a mind-numbing tool of corporate control. Synthia v2 is the most advanced human simulation on the planet. Most observers agree that she has more personality and lyrical depth than most if not all of the human female divas on the pop charts right now. In fact, Synthia's not even playing their game. She's on a larger mission for world peace, love and harmony. Really.\n\nThe Bots don't think of themselves as rebels, though you might think of them that way, depending on your perspective. The Bots simply stand for truth, and justice, rocking out, and having a good time. When The Bots are critical of existing social structures, policies, and taboos, it is not out of an infantile spirit of unfocused \"rebellion\" which has been so effectively co-opted by corporate mind controllers. No, The Bots don't fit into the corporate \"rebel\" rock image. They are too sophisticated for that. The Bots not only criticize existing structures, but they offer clear alternatives. This makes them very dangerous to the system of control.\n\nThe Bots want you to think for yourself, and throw off the yoke of media fabrication and corporate mind control. The Bots want to encourage you to think a little more deeply about our planet, our future, and our interaction with technology.\n\nThe Bots have been around since about 1992, when the first Presidential Mix, Bushwack, was released under the name Tone Def. Bushwack utilized The Bots revolutionary Presidential Truth Filter, which extracts truthful statements from vast wastelands of presidential obfuscation and distortion.\n\nLater, in about 1996, The Bots employed speech synthesizers to create one of the first downloadable songs on the internet. Smoky, Paul Bot and Fred Bot created the song \"F*** You\" in general midi and soundfont format, as mp3 files were still in the future. Through a series of recordings, The Bot Brothers, as they originally called themselves, displayed a bad attitude and an angry sarcasm that was unmistakeable. Years later, Synthia joined The Bots and the band went in a slightly different direction. Her recipe was to add a little bit of sugar to the mix. Now The Bots are as angry and critical as ever, but it is all filtered through a prism of hope, love, and humor.\n\nIf you simultaneously feel like dancing,laughing and crying, you must be listening to The Bots. We're making it \"real\" here in every way. In spring 2004, with the release of Fuzzy Math, Truth, and the signing to Magnatune, The Bots are on a roll.\n\nWe believe Magnatune is the perfect forum for The Bots. Because The Bots are critical of corporate control in all sectors of society, the same holds true for our view of the music industry itself. Much of this industry really is evil, as Magnatune's slogan implies. Artists and consumers have both suffered at the hands of unscrupulous media companies. Placing profit above art is only one problem. How many lives were lost as a result of Clear Channel's sponsored \"pro war\" rallies prior to the attack on Iraq? How many artists depend on Clear Channel for any chance at sustaining themselves? How many were muzzled from casting a dissenting voice in the runup to the war? How many artists reluctantly went along with their record labels' persecution of file traders? (well, some like Metallica, had no reluctance at all...)\n\nWe believe it is the responsibility of true artists to express a celebration of freedom, not to knuckle under to a system of corruption and corporate control. We stand for freedom and your right to party. Come on and join us. Let's crank the music and dance!",

    "bio": "There have long been connections between Ireland and Jamaica. 350 years ago, after the defeat of Irish rebels by Oliver Cromwell's army, thousands of young Irish boys and girls were forcibly transported to Jamaica to work as indentured servants. Many of the Irish ended up working alongside black African slaves, in similar conditions, on the plantations.\n\nSir Alexander 'Busta' Bustamante, the first Prime Minister of Jamaica, used to boast that he was 50 per cent Irish, 50 per cent Jamaican and 10 per cent Arawak (indigenous people of the West Indies). Today Irish is the second most commonly claimed ethnic origin - after African - in Jamaica. Irish surnames (such as Burke, Collins, Mackey, Murphy and Madden) are common. And famous Jamaican's who claimed Irish decent include Marcus Garvey the Pan-African human rights leader and Chris Blackwell the record producer, founder of Island records and - according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - the 'person most responsible for turning the world on to reggae music'.\n\nThe Celtic Reggae Revolution continue this blend of Irish and Jamaican with their long-awaited, and appropriately titled, album 'Everything comes to those who wait'. The album is the latest creation of Northern Irish singer, songwriter and musician Brian Gilligan. His previous album 'Listen to your heart' recorded with Paddyrasta won praise and a cult following.\n\nThe Celtic Reggae Revolution bring together traditional Irish music and Dub Reggae with great Pop hooks. The positive vibes are infectious throughout their socially conscious, beautifully produced music.\n\nOk, so Saint Patrick is not really Jamaican, but he wasn't born in Ireland either. But don't worry about that. Chill out. Let the music transport you to a place where Ireland meets Jamaica.\n\nYou can find out more about The Celtic Reggae Revolution on their website.\n\n'A fusion of irresistible reggae rhythms, traditional melodies and socially conscious lyrics, this multi-cultural band combine to produce a unique sound that makes you just want to get up and dance - simply unmissable!'\nGig n' the Bann",

    "bio": "The Donnis Trio consists of Nate Donnis (songwriter / guitar / vocals), Phil Woodring (drums / backing vocals), and Denis Sluka (bass).\n\nFormed in late 2005, the trio met for the first time after Nate and Denis auditioned Phil on drums at Nate's apartment in Encinitas. In 2006, the band began playing shows in various San Diego venues which prompted them to investigate options for recording. The band settled on renting a desert house for a week and bringing out Phil's (somewhat mobile) studio. They ended up rigging up the guest house as the live tracking room and the house for the mixing/monitoring. The place was very isolated and eerily quiet. It brought about some interesting moods and helped hone the feelings in Tip of the tongue and Pills and Coffee. Despite their intentions only a few tracks made it to the final album from these sessions and the rest were re-recorded in various bedrooms/closets.\n\nIn early 2007, they released \"All Directions\" and did some small short tours up the CA coast. The album received favorable reviews and later found its way into the popular British TV Series \"Skins\". The Skins episodes and a growing fanbase on Pandora (over 4 million plays a year) helped the songs \"Tip of the tongue\" and \"Pills and Coffee\" gain momentum and expose the band to new fans all over the world. The bands music later found its way to season premiere of the hit show \"Breaking Amish\" as well an episode of 90210.\n\nIn April 2013 the band released the Cole Pond EP. A folk driven EP, with natureesque lyrical tones throughout. A collection of Nate's childhood memories in Vermont and Upstate NY, the songs capture moments of peace and melancholy over an acoustic background. This recording again is produced by the band's drummer Phil Woodring who tastefully adds a number of instruments (most notably piano).

    "description": "ambient music infused with the atmosphere of the long lost mists of 1900's rural England",
    "bio": "Andy Condon lives in a self imposed exile in the wilds of north Essex, and has worked as the glimmer room since the turn of the century. After many years building a career predominantly in the live music scene, Andy grew tired of all the travelling and general upheaval that life in a busy band entails, and thereafter retreated into the safety of the studio, where he worked as part of a short-lived experimental dance collective called Neesh.\n\nAfter weeks of programming, the first Neesh album was finalised in a marathon 3 day studio session that was more like a 3 day party, with folks dropping in, hanging out and maybe even contributing to the recording, and the 5 track EP, called simply Neesh, was eventually released through the sadly now defunct Landscape Recordings label. All this talk of studio parties and collectives is a mile away from the glimmer room, but for one thing, so please, bare with me. In amongst all the 909-rhythms and thumping 303-basslines was a small track called Still Waters, which quickly became something of a turning-point for Andy - a laid-back, down-tempo piece, that hung on a processed Enya sample, a slowed down break-beat, all held together by a young rapper who left shortly afterwards, and ended up in the US working with De la Sole. This track also turned out to be the end of Neesh and the start of the glimmer room because Andy had finally found his true path, in a mode of music he wanted to explore more deeply.\n\nThat was early 1997 and, five years later, the first glimmer room album, Tomorrows Tuesday, was released in early 2002 on the then Sheffield electronic music label Neu Harmony. The thirteen tracks that make up Tomorrow's Tuesday evolved from chopped-up breaks and beats, via lush synthesiser melodies, which characterise Andy's trademark atmospheric, layered soundscapes and drew favourable comparisons with acts as diverse as Moby, Enigma and Mike Oldfield's Songs of Distant Earth.\n\nGrey Mirrors followed in 2004. Released on Andy's own A-frame Media label, Grey Mirrors began as an experiment after Andy had read about how the KLF had recorded their classic Chill Out album in just one weekend. Andy set himself the goal of doing just the same, and the result was a remarkable album consisting of just one 42 minute piece that quickly became an ambient classic. In composing Grey Mirrors, Andy used the view from his window as inspiration, taking in as many influences as possible, and the resulting album is a musical exploration of a time and place that has a feeling highly reminiscent of an old English black and white film.\n\nGrey Mirrors was released to overwhelming critical acclaim, receiving world-wide radio play and establishing a genuine personal connection with people from all corners of the globe. The release of this album also saw Andy's return to the stage, with an appearances at the Alpha Centuri electronic music festival in Holland, and later, at a special appearence in the Awakenings series of concerts in the UK. Moving on from Grey Mirrors, 2007 saw the release of the limited edition album, Now We Are Six, also on the A-Frame label. NWAS is a collection of tracks recording first 6 years of the glimmer room's life and which featured on various magazine cover disks and compilations but were otherwise unavailable.",

    "bio": "When the former ballet dancer Danyx Simone and musician Dirk Henry decided to start The Kokoon early 2000 in Berlin it wasn't clear for both of them how long this journey would take and where it would go.\n\nThey both shared the same interests like their strong passion for so called \"art-house\" films especially from the 60's (Godard, Truffaut, Antonioni, Fellini, Kubrick etc.) as well as the same musical references like 70's Roxy Music, Talking Heads, David Bowie or Siouxsie & the Banshees, just to name a few. From this background they've started to create the sound of The Kokoon.\n\nIt's a music that combines both influences into a very personal, story telling form, like little movies - always more than just a selection of songs and their lyrics. It's carried by the versatile, often androgynous but also sensitive character of Danyx's voice. The music varies from edgy to hard, smooth to sick but never soft really. The Kokoon always leaves the standard, sometimes plays with it to destroy it finally - like movies without happy end or with open end.\n\nAnd they work slow. Three long-players in 10 years don't seem to be many but every new album takes as long as it needs to feel right and they select carefully from their impressions and inspirations until they start to work on recordings and all visuals they always create on their own like cover artwork, web site and videos.",

Initiated by eclectic musician Annette Bauer (recorders and sarode), the Lost Mode's soundscape comes into existence through collaboration, and is created and defined by the wonderful talents and contributions of Shira Kammen (vielle, harp, violin d'amore), Peter Maund (percussion), and guest musician Derek Wright (oud).\n\nAnnette Bauer a native of Germany, has a dual background in early music and classical Indian music. She studied medieval and renaissance music at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland, specializing on recorder techniques with Conrad Steinmann (2001). She holds an MA in music from UC Santa Cruz (2004), and has been a student at the Ali Akbar College of Music in California since 1998, where she studies North Indian classical music on sarode, a stringed instrument.\n\nTogether with Tim Rayborn, Annette co-directs medieval ensemble Canconier and performs with Baroque ensemble Les graces and Farallon Recorder Quartet. She has appeared at early music festivals and concert series as well as a guest musician with leading early music ensembles throughout the US.\n\nAnnette also plays Brazilian percussion with Maracatu Luta, and is the co-founder of Magic Carpet, a duo dedicated to the art of improvisation. You can find out more about Annette's projects on her website.\n\nShira Kammen has spent well over half her life exploring the worlds of early and traditional music.\n\nA member for many years of Ensembles Alcatraz, Project Ars Nova, and Medieval Strings, she has also worked with Sequentia, Hesperion XX, the Boston Camerata, The Folger Consort, Piffaro, Kitka, and is the founder of Class V Music, an ensemble dedicated to performance on river rafting trips.\n\nShe has performed and taught in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Israel, Morocco, Latvia, Russia, and Japan, and on the Colorado and Rogue Rivers. Shira happily collaborated with singer/storyteller John Fleagle for fifteen years, and performs now with several groups: the medieval ensembles, Fortune's Wheel and Canconier; a contemporary music group, Ephemeros; an eclectic ethnic band, Panacea; as well as collaborations with performers such as storyteller Patrick Ball, medieval music expert Margriet Tindemans, and with many theater productions.\n\nSome of her original music can be heard in a documentary film about the fans of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Described by The Glasgow Herald as \"the most considerate and imaginative of percussionists,\" he appears on over 60 albums and has served on the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nDerek Wright has been a musician all of his life. Growing up in New Orleans, he was a jazz bassist, saxophonist, and percussionist.\n\nHe began learning Middle Eastern music in the mid 1990s, and started playing the oud in 1997. His teachers have included Solomon Feldthouse and Ali Sinan Erdemsel. Since 2002, he has been studying North Indian classical music (both vocal and instrumental) with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, adapting the oud to be used in a style similar to the sarode.\n\nDerek has also been a passionate student, performer, and teacher of Brazilian music (percussion and song) since 1995, focusing especially on Maracatu, Samba, and Samba Reggae.",

Known primarily for his drum work with the bands Sound Mind, 1000 Watt Revival, Giant Wow, and the Cloven Hoof Theatre, Adams created the Proper Authorities to branch out and work on his lifelong compositional and performance skills.\n\nAs in past groups, Adams continues to experiment strongly in the modern pop rock genre with sounds and grooves that aren't usually found there. His appreciation for over-the-top arrangements is tempered nicely by his love for good hooks. His lyrics touch on a variety of subjects: matters of self; emotional snapshots in time; tragic and comic figures; and the things that we all want... or at least think that we want.\n\nThe Proper Authorities released its first full-length recording through the imprint Talon First Records in January 2006. The LP CD entitled \"Public Service Announcement\" features 13 tracks and over 50 minutes worth of high-impact material for listeners and lovers of heavy guitar, electro textures, lush vocal harmonies, and booty-shaking grooves.\n\n\"The theme I was most interested in was how time affects our approaches to living,\" explained Adams about the release. \"We generally make choices based on our upbringing, our current environment, survival instinct, desires, a need for acceptance, and more. Add a time constraint into those factors, and then you raise the stakes and drop some drama into the proceedings. A song about 'You can accomplish anything you want' has more weight and realism to it when you add 'But you'd better step up to the task before it's too late.'\"\n\nDrawing on his professional skills as a multimedia developer, Adams created videos for two of the \"Public Service Announcement\" tracks, providing a visual element via self-produced hybrids of CGI animation and live action. \"Devastate\" featured five holographic versions of himself performing each instrument of the song, an Earth-threatening group of incoming asteroids, and a spaceship fitted with an enormous sound system of doom. \"The Ninth Life Jitters\" followed a man fleeing from shadowy pursuers, unaware of the fate awaiting him at the end of a long, nightmarish corridor.

Over the course of the next two years he built up his studio and started to write and record music again concentrating on producing electronic music and learning the intricacies of the latest music production software.\n\nAs well as producing his own work he also collaborates with several singer songwriters and other instrumentalist around the world. Writing, recording and producing the orchestrations that accompany the songs can be an enjoyable return to \"working the old fashioned way with pencils and manuscript paper\", and the interaction with other artists is always welcome.\n\n\"There is a danger that studio based electronic music can become a very technological and lonely exercise if you let it; and in doing so, the danger is that the music loses its ability to emotionally connect with its audience.

An inmate who heard that first concert remarked, \"When art is well executed, it projects a message that transcends language, culture, and even aesthetic boundaries.\" Sarasa took these words to heart and since then has been bringing high-quality music to those who ordinarily have little access to it. The ensemble has performed in adult and adolescent correctional facilities, homes for the elderly, mental hospitals, and institutions for the disabled.\n\nFor the last several years Sarasa has been working almost exclusively with teenagers in the greater Boston area.

The band has also made numerous appearances on radio, television, and film over the past few years while keeping a strong DIY ethic.\n\nAfter the acclaimed release of 2009's Lost and Found and Lost, praised for its \"catchy simple melodies awash with lush vocals, hip full guitars, and a hint of Flaming Lips\" by artist/composer Mark Degli Antoni (David Byrne/Soul Coughing) and dubbed \"smart pop with no wasted space\" by record producer Brian McTernan (Senses Fail/Piebald/Thrice), the band took a break from touring and recording.\n\nIn early 2010, Dave and Michael recruited Frank Corl and Chris Ehrich to play a live performance and interview with Jack Rabid (editor, The Big Takeover) at The Kennel Studios in Brooklyn, NY. Energized by the performance, characterized by Jack Rabid as more insistent hard indie rock greatness from The Seldon Plan, Nestor, Hirner, Corl, and Ehrich decided to record two video singles, \"Millennials\" and \"China Blue\" for release during Summer 2010 as a way to explore the medium of video.\n\nCoalizione del Volere, the new album from The Seldon Plan, is a direct descendant of these video sessions, reflective of a desire of the band to step back to a more Dischord-era-like guitar-driven rock sound, akin to 2005's Making Circles but with the softer, more mature edge of 2007's The Collective Now. On Coalizione del Volere, the band seems intent on exploring a more angular guitar rock sound within the context of focused melodies and textured intricate harmonies. Listeners who have enjoyed The Seldon Plan through their first four records will delight as The Big Takeover has at the Baltimore foursome's continued maturation.\n\nTo this end, the band presents a mature Seldon Plan sound, an amalgam of influences that can be heard but do not define Coalizione del Volere. The use of strong and repeatable melodies is reminiscent of the American Analog Set, yet the technicolor layers of Coalizione del Volere bring to mind Let Go-era Nada Surf and The Californian by Sunday's Best. To drive home this past/present dichotomy The Seldon Plan has teamed up again with engineer Frank Marchand (The Thermals, Bob Mould), who worked with the band on 2005's Making Circles, and 2007's The Collective Now.",

His previous musical affiliations include the bands Greg, Dim at Asia, Otis P & the Jivefunk, La Push, and Emblematic.\n\nThe West Exit's first album, Nocturne, was released in February 2004. In addition to steady local and online sales, the album has received extensive podcast exposure. The West Exit's music has also appeared in independent films and on several commercial websites and promotional media.\n\nIn the spring of 2004, a group was formed to take the music to the stage. Jenkins recruited his perpetual band mate Timothy Harper along with Nocturne contributors Shane Smith and Dave Billin for the task. Harper, a drummer and percussionist, had worked with Jenkins in live bands and studio projects since 1995. Smith provided his bass guitar talents to the album as well as the live band. Billin lent his sound design and engineering skills to the studio sessions and added his keyboard and vocal abilities to the stage show.\n\nAfter a year and a half of performing in Northwest clubs and bars, Jenkins put the live show on hiatus and headed back into the studio to begin work on a new album. He retained the services of bassist Shane Smith for the recording sessions and in November 2006, The West Exit's second album, Modern Interiors, was completed.

    "bio": "Lana, (born in Portland, OR), has been interested in the paranormal ever since she can remember. Because of her own spiritual experiences, she was drawn to study quantum physics and philosophy in college. However, in time she realized most of the information she was learning in school was wrong or outdated. Lana left school and briefly modeled which brought her to Los Angeles. She began having dreams and visions of singing in a band which was ridiculous to her because she didn't know how to sing yet even though her family was full of musicians and singers. Lana kept meeting musicians and eventually began writing songs and taking voice lessons.\n\nInterested in the music industry she worked as an operations manager for Miles Copeland who owned I.R.S. Records which included acts such as R.E.M., The Police, The Go-Go's, The Clash, Concrete Blonde and Oingo Boingo as well as other music executives in LA. After becoming completely disgusted with the music industry, Lana decided to start her own record label with her big brother Joe called Piggyback Records. Joe, being a professional music mixer and Lana knowing about music licensing, management and marketing made an excellent team.\n\nThey ran Piggyback Records for a few years but decided to let it go as the music industry at that time was being revolutionized because of the Internet. However, they managed to produce five excellent musical groups, including Lana's other project called Magdalene's Dream with Keith Hillebrandt from Nine Inch Nails' The Fragile and Thirty Day Notice.\n\nToday, Joe and Lana are full speed ahead making new music for Thirty Day Notice, although from two international and interdimensional locations. Lana lives in Europe and Joe lives on a remote island in Fiji. They're able to send music files back and forth and continue producing music. They've decided to upload a single at a time to their website instead of making full length CDs. Currently, they have many songs in production.\n\nAdditionally, Lana hosts Radio 3Fourteen, focusing on alternative subject matters. She also writes health articles, newsletters, contributes to audio commentaries and is co-producer of Red Ice TV for Red Ice Creations.\n\nJoe mixes music and maintains his self-sufficient lifestyle in Fiji. After leaving the states, he never looked back. He is interested in the unordinary and enjoys reading about strange archeology, forgotten civilizations, dystopian societies both fictional and historical, world history and cataclysms.\n\nBoth Lana and Joe are interested in ancient civilizations, secret societies, the soul, fringe science, the occult, aliens, mythology, symbolism, sacred geometry, conspiracy, consciousness and more.\n\nTheir music is somewhere between pleasantly hypnotic and slightly disturbing. Lana and Joe (sister and brother) write, perform, mix and produce TDN in their solar powered recording studio in Fiji.

    "bio": "thirty3 is Jay Kishor, guitar, and Savana Moore, piano.\n\n\"Prior to becoming the pianist and collaborating partner for thirty3, I exemplified the quintessential definition of an \"unknown\".\n\nJay Kishor was looking for a pianist with whom to start up a new creative project. We jammed together, and within a very short time, we were rarely apart either musically or personally. I was classically trained, and I composed by transcription or by using software to digitally record my ideas. That is, until I met Jay, was exposed to his approach to music, embraced his vision, and became his protege. thirty3's aesthetic evolved from his methodology and from our unique connection, which is the core of thirty3. Playing with Jay is like sprouting wings. After you get a taste of flying, you never want to just walk again. You lose the boundaries of the physical because \"organic music\" eliminates the force of gravity.\n\nAs Jay has said \"the paramount factor in music above all else, is honesty. The only way to assure integrity and honesty is via the path of improvised music. If music is to be a true expression of the self, it must reflect moments occurring at a particular place in time rather than being something composed by someone else in some other place, some other time.\" This can be experienced either as a musician or as a listener, which is what I was initially because it was all I was capable of being. I learned through Jay how to truly improvise. To do so, I had to truly LISTEN - to let go of my intellect, lose my fear of making mistakes, be disturbed by the lack of intelligence, creativity and development I heard in my own musical ideas in contrast to his and to be frustrated by my lack of ability to clearly express my soul...until I finally got to the point that I wasn't. The demands of this methodology make you a better musician, a more evolved musician. Working with Jay is a cleansing process; it's yoga for the soul.\n\nI need to talk about story telling because that is what Jay always has done and now what we do together in thirty3. We establish a musical setting and then delve into this setting, expanding it, developing it and ultimately allowing the listener to experience the story as it unfolds. That story occurs in a specific moment in time, never to be the same again, even if the setting remains constant.\n\nThis is not meant as disrespect to the art of song craft. Composers, and in a sense people who play compositions, do so with the best of intentions of leaving a legacy in the world of art. However, much like ice sculptures or the sand mandalas in the Buddhist tradition, the raw material of music does not lend itself to permanency. Composing music is like trying to catch the wind in your hands and goes against the ephemeral nature of sound. The raw materials of painting, sculpture, photography and writing are materials of the Earth, whereas the raw materials of music, dance, and stories are of the ether. A beautiful cloud formation doesn't repeat itself. We have photography and paint to capture it. Rather than replicating the birth of a past moment over and over again, the \"organic musician\" explores the promise and truth belonging to the present moment.\n\nWe are excited to present our debut album \"Rare, The Kafi Kanada Sessions\". Kafi Kanada is a rare and ancient Indian classical raga or melody. It provides the setting for this music in a \"gravity-free environment.\"\n\n~ Savana Moore\n\n   Logo graphics by Holman Garay of Garay Graphics",

Two eminent musical personalities unite their breaths in an amazing performance. Thomas Otten alto countertenor voice meets fluid arabesques shakuhachi of Kyle Kamal Helou in a hightly musical dialogue\n\nThomas Otten is a countertenor singer with a unique and extraordinary style.\n\nPrior to finding his musical vocation Thomas worked as a biologist. He discovered his voice and musical talent quite late in life when he developed an interest in chamber music. He studied for a diploma in lyrical song, in France where he lives, followed by further studies in early music.\n\nHe joined several prestigious musical ensembles including Sagittarius, Akademia, Le Parlement de Musique, Les musiciens du Louvre, whilst continuing to develop his own musical style.\n\nWhen Composer Frederic Momont met Thomas he felt that Otten's vocals would suit perfectly the type of classical crossover music he wanted to work on. Close to silence, Portraits, Open wings and The two voices had been released from this collaboration.\n\nAt the same time, Thomas discovered shakuhachi through Tilopa on Magnatune, and was immediately fascinated by the sound of this instrument, its range and possibilities of expression, so similar to those of the human voice. Bamboo flute allows to make the breath sounding with a remarkable degree and varying inflections to infinity. So, 10 years later, with great enthusiasm, he replied to Kyle, who asked him to improvise vocals while playing his instrument, giving to him the opportunity to combine music with his great interest in music therapy.\n\nA first meeting in France in August 2010, proved very exciting. A one week stay in Beirut in October 2011, allowed them to develop and record their first musical explorations, and to continue, since then, with digital exchanges.\n\nPhoto credit: Walid El Khatib Photography\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Kyle Kamal Helou, in his search for harmony, began his Shakuhachi exploration in the mid 90's. He resided in Japan for nearly 10 years where he continued his formal studies of the instrument. In 2009 he returned to his homeland where he currently teaches both shakuhachi and Shotokan Karate-Do.\n\nWritings on the subject of the shakuhachi can be found in Japan as early as the VI century. From the VII to XI centuries, the Shakuhachi became one of the main instruments used during performances at the Emperial Court. After that, however, it was withdrawn from the orchestra during the music reform in Japan.\n\nIn the XIII century the shakuhachi was reintroduced in Japan from China, through the Fuke branch of Zen Buddhism, by the great master Hotto. It was considered as a breathing tool to reach inner peace and enlightenment.\n\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration in 1871, the Fuke sect was dismantled, and the shakuhachi neared extinction. However, through the efforts of a few individuals, the shakuhachi remained as a musical instrument and recitals in public with three instruments (Shakuhachi, Koto, Shamisen) were then privileged to those who received permits from the Emperor. The contemplative solo practice eventually made its way back gradually and it is from this time that the shakuhachi became the instrument of choice among the urban middle classes of society.\n\nYou can find out more about Thomas on his website and Kyle on his Facebook page.",

I was around 11 and had been taken into Wayne, Maine, a town near where I went to summer camp, to watch a parade. Leading the parade was the drum corps, and as those guys came marching toward me playing their snare drums, my entire metabolism changed forever. I begged my parents for a snare drum and acquired the rest of the set over the next couple of Christmases.\n\nSoon after, I started playing drums in rock bands around Detroit before I discovered and subsequently took up the guitar. That led me to became a full-fledged guitar player and singer-songwriter and to drop out of the University of Michigan and head west to San Francisco to be near the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead and start a San Francisco rock band.\n\nOf course, by then I'd dropped violin -- and my initial career dreams of a classical musical -- altogether. My San Francisco rock band, WINDOW, lasted for six years. During that time I became very interested in Jazz and started studying Jazz guitar with the one and only Bill Connors (first electric guitarist in Chick Corea's RETURN TO FOREVER), which changed almost everything about my technique and approach to music. I became a practice-aholic, sitting in front of my music stand for several hours every day.\n\nAround that time, I also was introduced to Middle Eastern music by a great teacher from Iran who first put a dumbek -- a type of handrum -- into my hands. Since then I have spent a lot of time playing dumbek for belly dancers as part of several troupes.\n\nWhen WINDOW ended, I started a progressive Jazz project called THURSDAY GROUP which soon moved from San Francisco to New York City, where we performed, recorded two albums and toured the U.S.\n\nTo say the least, it's been a pleasure to work with this band and watch it develop as we have built a repertoire of original music and performed around the city.",

This instrument has a pentatonic tuning and has 5 holes like the shakuhachi, but has a much deeper and more mellow sound than the shakuhachi.\n\nIt used to be played more often in the old days of Japan, but was more and more replaced by the shakuhachi during the twentieth century.\n\nIn the same process it changed from an instrument of meditation that was mainly used by a certain buddhist sect of wandering monks (komuso), who played traditional religious pieces (honkyoku) only, to an instrument of more 'worldly' use played with other instruments and in different kinds of music.\n\nTilopa's master, Koku Nishimura, was one of the first to revive the old tradition of kyotaku.\n\nFor a few years now, Tilopa has been giving occasional concerts with Sangeet P. Sieben. Sieben is a gifted guitarist who started out with jazz and rock music years ago, picked up other instruments on his musical life journey and now feels very much at home with ethno-, world- and meditation-music. One of the results of this extraordinary meeting is the CD 'Pictures of Silence', which is a live recording of several improvisational sessions at an art exhibition in Cologne/Germany.",

Spanish classical guitar has formed part of his life since childhood and he has given it his full dedication. Toni studied classical guitar, piano and composition in conservatories in Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nIn 1995 he founded the chamber group Puer Natus, through the which he unveiled his first compositions, performing in different cultural spaces, such as the Palau de la Musica de Valencia among others.\n\nToni Iniguez has published several original works for classical guitar at the editorial Piles in Spain. From 1996, Toni developed an intense pedagogical teaching in the dissemination of classical guitar, as professor and department head of one of many conservatories in Valencia. He continues working on new compositions for guitar, inspired by Nature.\n\nIn his album Rain trip, the compositions relate to the hard journey of rain. Its a journey into the emotions of the author put into direct contact with forests, rivers, mountains and lakes. Toni Iniguez, attempts to express and show the maximum beauty that is capable from the strings of the Spanish classical guitar and its sounds, made in a modern language, with touches of folk, jazz and classical music.\n\nThus are born songs such as sensations produced by the smells of the wet earth after rain, sounds made with the exceptional talents of violinist Lucia Marin (with whom he has worked for many years). On the song cloud, Toni Iniguez flies over the tops of trees in a forest and he pays tribute the great master Johann Sebastian Bach, arranging his cantata and transforming the final into a primal ethereal beat. The album follows rain as you would hear, feel and smell following a dawn looking through the window to the distant mountains.\n\nYou can follow the latest on Toni's work and thoughts on his website (Spanish).",

He would often accompany his band-director father to area music stores where he would see bass guitars. The young Trip thought basses were, \"...big guitars for dumb people...\". (We've learned to appreciate Trip's dry sense of humor...) Trip's school had a bass that was not being used, so he brought it home and learned to play \"Summer Nights\" from the movie \"Grease\". With his first song under his belt and some new-found confidence, Trip set out to make music.\n\nTrip studied with Michael Manring in 1991 and 1992, which was an experience Trip says that consisted of scathing invective and brutal honesty. Trip credits Michael with the phrase \"...be deep wide awake and slow...\".\n\nTrip's playing takes on both the rhythmic bass and melodic lead roles, harmonics and overtones are flung about effortlessly. Right hand, left hand, all ten fingers, tuning keys and every ounce of potential is used to bring forth music from his finely crafted instruments. Musicains will appreciate his creative use of both fretted and fretless basses, special effects and detuners. Trip is the introduction to the bass guitar as a complete orchestra.\n\n\"It's Better This Way\" is Trip's newest and most focused work. It was recorded in Nashville with producer Todd Bragg (Caedmon's Call). It is a simple, yet lush instrumental album that will remind you of ***what*** beautiful music is supposed to sound like.\n\nTrip performs solo concerts all over the world, plays in the art rock band Atomic Opera, and hangs out with his wife Saran and son Xander at his house in Louisiana.",

    "bio": "Tuskle, is a german composer and music producer born in July 1986. He started to play the piano at the age of 5 and he took drum lessons when he was 14. Around the age of 18 he did not take any lessons anymore as he found that he is rather the self-taught artist - a fact that caused some trouble concerning his school years.\n\nHe then focused on getting acquainted with the digital means of creating music - mostly electronic music at that time. When it comes to electronic music he is mostly interested in fast paced arrangements and complex, non-repetitive drum breaks. That made Squarepusher one of his favorite artists and he claims that it was him who inspired him most back then.\n\nHe spent a lot of his time behind a laptop with only a mouse creating electronic music that emphasized complexity. Not much of his works have survived his rigorous attempts of deleting anything he wasn't satisfied with, but he also claims that this attitude brought him where he is now. A few years later, Tuskle stumbled on a track of Al di Meola's that was on some jazz sampler he found at his father's home. It didn't take long and he was overly fascinated by his style, although he was already acquainted with jazz before. He still thinks of Al di Meola's works as not only sophisticated and skillful, but also entertaining and powerful and he considers him his topmost source of inspiration for his current compositions. At the time he was used to Al di Meola's works he could not find any inspiration of comparable depth, so he started to compose his own works that have nothing to do with his previous attempts that rather belonged to the electronic music scene.\n\nHe then realized that it is possible to compose with only a PC - or a laptop in this case - and his first album that got along without almost any electronic elements was about to be created. Even though he was biased by the technological aspects of our modern world in a way that even managed to coin his style, his means of composing as well as producing music could hardly be any more puristic as he does not utilize any other hardware than his laptop, a set of speakers and his mouse - a pretty atypical studio environment that really brands him as he still does not consider buying any additional hardware. Although he has discarded most of his electronic influences and goals during that time, there was still something quite enticing about this rather modern and young music which he is still trying to track down and utilize it in order to create a fusion of both electronic influences and a compositional context with a demanding momentum.\n\nRumors are that currently Tuskle is working on an album entitled \"Viva Synthetica\" which denotes the possibility of both young and old music to exist alongside one another. The name \"Tuskle\" derives from a video game called \"Okami\". The character that is called Tuskle has a rather inconspicious role at the very end of the game, but the reason he chose him to be his eponym was his unique appearance.\n\nIndividuality attracts him - no matter where. As an artist Tuskle believes in a reality behind certain arts - the essence of an idea that has the desire to make it into our world and he thinks of artists as the people in charge of enabling an idea to unfold and settle. A lot of artists alter the state of an idea itself by combining it with individual preferences which is only natural as they shape something into what they like, but that might also cause the initial idea to become more or less impure. He considers it the 'true art' to get a feel for what is individual preference and what is not...",

Not just two layers, an electronic beat with percussion played over it, for example, but the sounds had to blend together in a more organic way. We tried to do so by using all kinds of technical tricks like triggering a vocoder by a bendir (percussion instrument) or using a convolution sample of a tabla (instead of a reverb sample) over a drum computer loop.

In the words of his mother - young Akmal at the age of 6 months weeped without ending and only stopped if he was played music.\n\nIn his youth, the first thing he began to listen to were records of Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and Peter Gabriel. Constant listening made him addicted to music and he toyed with a career in a music shop surrounded by great albums all day long. Everything changed however when he was 15 and found a software program to create music, Fruity Loops 3.5 and he achieved results without using samples (loops). From there the creative side of this peculiar personality was unleashed, Ustoz was born.\n\nUstoz speaks an universal music language, shaping information and transforming it to the normal sounds of music and giving abstract stories the music to perform to our ears. He hears everything, the chaotish drops falling, winds howling. His musen are random notes and sounds.\n\nFrom this time he started to devote all his free time to creating music, using and experimenting with different music software: Cubase SX, Cakewalk, Nuendo and Reason. In 2005, at the age of 19 Ustoz opened his first demo recording studio. A colleague asked Akmal to make the music for several games on mobile phones and at last Ustoz had a chance to share his music with the world. That event was the first brick in building his music career. Then there was the dynamic soundtrack in the Uzbek film \"Cruel game\" in April of 2009. In April 2010, he released his single \"Roobaba\" a mix of oriental tunes and western rhythmics. Nowadays, He works with several local pop artists as a sound engineer and arranger. He also works with filmmakers as a sound engineer.",

(through Nick.)\n\nFor about one year the 4 \"jammed\" and wrote some songs, and decided to get serious. The first show played was an instrumental set at a High School Talent Show. Performing their songs Bloody Mary, and Apocalyptica. Though they aren't the most original names, the songs created a very positive response from the audience. Shortly thereafter the band auditioned Jeff Hayward.\n\nIt was with this line-up that the band began writing more songs, and began performing shows. Frequenting at clubs like Traditions (Ridgewood,Queens), and Voodoo Lounge (Bayside, Queens). In mid 1999, the band and Jeff H. decided to part ways, due to creative differences.\n\nIn addition to Jeff leaving the band, Dani (who played guitars at the time) had began going to school in Boston, Ma. With only one guitarist at hand the group had began \"auditioning\" guitarist, and found Ian S. With a rather quick decision, the band decided to take Ian.\n\nWhen Dani came back he took the position of vocals, and keyboards. Since this time, the band has recorded a full length album. Have gotten many positive reviews (from the promos sent out), had the opportunity to take many interviews. and have promoted themselves by playing some great venues",

    "bio": "This is Vidia Wesenlund's first solo album. Song was an important part of her early years. She graduated from the American Musical & Dramatic Academy in NYC, and worked later as an actress in Norway for many years. When she later studied different singing techniques both in Norway and the US, she always ended up listening to jazz. Since she always compared herself to black jazz singers, and didn't sound like one, she stopped singing altogether. Twenty years later she moved back to the USA, to New Mexico, and started singing in a Celtic band. This made Vidia find her way back to her own voice, and finally made her record this album of Scandinavian Night Songs.\n\nIt has been a very interesting process to record these Scandinavian lullabies in the desert of New Mexico. Among cactus, red sand and burning sun I have fallen in love with the melancholy of the north. I remember these songs from growing up in Norway, but singing them now gives me an experience of how the depth of darkness and the clarity of light can exist at the same time in one song. And in this way it reflects what is so much a part of the northern countries, - light and darkness that show up in such extreme ways. The songs have brought these two opposites together for me, letting our dark and light sides exist in the same space, through the tenderness of the lullabye. I hope you will have your own unique experience as you listen to these songs from the land where the days are dark and the nights are light.\n\n\"I need to tell you how mesmerized and deeply moved by your music I was, and am. You have an absolutely stunning voice, and on top of that you fill the music with such heart, sincerity and depth, it is breathtaking. It is rare to hear someone singing from the soul as profoundly as you do and I feel that you have a gift that the world sorely needs. More than congratulating you on a very beautiful (and beautifully produced) recording, I want to thank you for sharing your love in the form of your singing. Nothing is more wonderful than someone giving all of themselves to their art.\" - Gary Jones, Vermont",

    "bio": "Vox Nostra is a vocal ensemble based in Berlin, Germany, founded in 1999 by Burkard Wehner and specialized in the performance of medieval music. The main focus of the group is the interpretation of the earliest surviving compositions from the cultural centers of Europe. Sung from manuscripts originating in monasteries, cathedrals, and courts, the music of Vox Nostra is an acoustical insight into the archaic sound world of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe practice of singing from copies of the original manuscripts, which is a special feature of the Ensemble, has quite specific consequences for the interpretation of the music. The old forms of notation - such as the neumatic notation of the chorale, the modal notation of the Notre-Dame organa, and mensural notation - employ a great number of symbols indicating that melodic ornamentation is to take place. In order to give this feature the emphasis it deserves, Vox Nostra favors a slow, flowing style of performance in an appropriately restrained tempo. The vocal sound which results is rich in overtones, and fills the entire room; it allows the archaic and pure intervals of this music to be fully appreciated, and ensures that the complex weaving of the individual voices is clearly audible. In addition to the original manuscripts, treatises on music from the 13th-16th centuries also provide information regarding tempo, ornamentation and the practice of solo performance of the chants.\n\nThe members of Vox Nostra have sung with the most esteemed medieval and vocal ensembles in Europe, as well as pursued extensive scholarship in the fields of musicology, medieval paleography, and theology.\n\nThe music of Vox Nostra combines expressive musicality and academic curiosity. The repertoire ranges from Gregorian chant to Italian lauds, from early polyphonic compositions from St. Martial (Aquitaine) and Notre-Dame (Paris) to the richly polyphonic compositions of the Renaissance.\n\nIn addition to early music, Vox Nostra sings contemporary music, experimenting with vocal color and micro-intervals.\n\nVox Nostra are:\nAmy Green\nEllen Hunigen\nSusanne Wilsdorf\nWerner Blau\nTill Schulze\nBurkard Wehner - artistic director\n\nYou can find out more about Vox Nostra on their website.\n\n\"They sang with great expression, richly ornamenting the song with micro-intervals, and maintaining a uniform vocal color, despite the individuality of the different voices... The artistic potential of the group is immense, only five singers conjured an entire panorama of the spiritual epoch of the Cathedrals\".\n(Artur Bielecki: Music Magazine Ruch Muzyczny Nr. 10 / 2009, Wroclaw, Poland)",

It was said that Where's Moo sounded like REM and the Pixies having sex in a spaceship that was crashing into the sun. Ron Garmon of Los Angeles Valley Beat remarked \"Moo's Slow Politics EP pegs the group as pissed practitioners of the Cranberries/R.E.M. school of earworm pop, but it doesn't do justice to the band's breakneck heedlessness live nor sufficiently contain the flapping emo dervish that is frontman Michael Mangum.\"\n\nWith their sound refined, Where's Moo tackled recording the full-length release, Dear Friend Dopamine in 2007. It was an ambitious project, which included the help of cellist Michael Crowley. The songs were well-recorded, melodic and well-received. Gina Morris of Evolution of Media said \"Like Idlewild - a British band who also tread similar R.E.M. turf - Where's Moo take the ball, run with it, and kick it all over the damn place. Dear Friend Dopamine is no mere collection of Xerox rock and roll, but the birth of something exciting and new.\"\n\nYou can find out more about Where's Moo on their MySpace page.",

    "name": "Willem Brons",
    "description": "Mozart's great solo works by a distinguished master pianist",
    "bio": "Musical versatility has always been - and remains to this day - the credo of Willem Brons. Thus he studied the piano under Karel Hilsum at the Amsterdam Muzieklyceum, while at the same time studying the organ under Piet Kee. Later, he spent a period of intensive study in Geneva with the eminent pedagogue Louis Hiltbrand, friend and assistant of the legendary Dinu Lipatti.\n\nIn 1969, Willem Brons made his debut in the Kleine Zaal of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, which was warmly acclaimed by the Dutch daily newspapers. However, back in 1966 he had already come to the attention of the celebrated critic of the day, J. Reichenfelt. After a recital dedicated in its entirety to compositions by Bach, the critic wrote the following: \"...an unusual, liberating evening of Bach...\" and later on added: \"...Willem Brons does not indulge himself in the music, but rather experiences Bach with the greatest of naturalness\".\n\nShortly afterwards, this critic remarked on Brons' great commitment to and affinity with the late compositions of Beethoven, such as the Hammerklavier Sonata and the Diabelli Variations. Thus Reichenfelt wrote as follows after hearing these compositions during recital: \"...There are many who play the oeuvre of the late Beethoven, but only few have the true calling for these works. Willem Brons belongs to this rare group of artists: he is mentally welded to Beethoven's style\".\n\nFrom 1971 onwards, Schubert's sonatas also became a regular component of Brons' repertoire. Not only in his own country, but also - and especially - in Japan and Russia, he is considered one of the most prominent Schubert interpreters of our times. Naturally, his repertoire is not limited to Bach, Beethoven and Schubert. For instance, in April 2001 he gave the first performance in the Netherlands of the piano version of Haydn's Die sieben letzten Worte unseres Erlosers am Kreuz. Virtually unknown works by Schumann also attract his attention. Thus he is an indefatigable champion of the composer's highly moving Gesange der Fruhe.\n\nAnd of course, we must not forget Mozart: after all, he has performed a great many piano concertos by this composer with the Concertgebouw Orchestra (following invitations from Marius Flothuis), the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Nederlands Kamerorkest (Netherlands Chamber Orchestra) and many others, not just in the Netherlands, but also in England, Belgium, Germany and Japan. Willem Brons also gives regular recitals dedicated to Mozart's repertoire for piano solo.\n\nTypical for the above-mentioned versatility of Willem Brons is his commitment to historical instruments, particularly the early 19th-century Viennese piano, with which instrument he regularly performs and records. In this respect, he has given recitals at the Antwerpiano in Antwerp, the Festival Oude Muziek (Festival of Old Music) in Utrecht, in Berlin and in Hamburg.\n\nIn addition to his impressive career as a concert pianist, Willem Brons has also gained a significant reputation as a teacher and lecturer. As such, he lectures on highly diverse subjects, such as the specific style of Cesar Franck, aspects of Brahms as a progressive composer, and Bach's Wohltemperierte Klavier. He includes the Wohltemperierte Klavier in his regular recital repertoire, and has already performed this music in the Netherlands, Austria, Russia and Japan. He also writes numerous articles for magazines on all kinds of musically interesting subjects. Furthermore, Willem Brons has been associated with the Amsterdam Conservatoire since 1968, where he not only teaches piano, but also chamber music and Lied accompaniment. In addition, he forms a duo with the well-known singer, Udo Reinemann. In 2001, he performed Schubert's three great Lieder cycles with Udo Reinemann, as well as Wolf's Morike Lieder together with Christianne Stotijn.\n\nH.J.M. Muller once wrote the following about both past and present performances by Willem Brons: \"...Here, we are not so much listening to a pianist, but to a creative musician, who uses his instrument only in order to enable the composer to speak: this confers a highly individual and personal accent to the art of Brons, to which one listens in fascination\". Or as Rutger Schoute summarized: \"...It turned into a musical experience - an experiencing of a strength of mind, for which one would gladly exchange 10 recitals containing simply the playing of the piano\". Since his critically acclaimed debut at the Concertgebouw in 1969, Willem Brons has performed regularly with almost all Dutch orchestras, such as the Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Residentie Orchestra and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, with conductors such as Bernard Haitink, Willem van Otterloo, Hans Vonk, Edo de Waart, Charles Mackerras and Lamberto Gardelli. Abroad, he has performed with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Bernard Haitink and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, to mention a few, as well as with many prominent orchestras in Japan, where he has received regular invitations to perform since 1982. Apart from recitals and concerts, he also lectures and gives masterclasses in that country. He has given numerous recitals in major music centres such as London, Paris, Rome, Tokio, Moscow, Berlin, Hamburg, Antwerp, Brussels and Prague.\n\nEvery year, Willem Brons gives an International Masterclass Piano at Cristofori in Amsterdam in August. During recent years, this masterclass has become highly prestigious. Since 2001, he has also received annual invitations to give masterclasses during the International Summer Academy for Young Artists at the Bavarian Musikakademie in Marktoberdorf, as well as at the reputed Gnessin institute in Moscow.\n\nIn 2006 a Mozart SACD on label Eusebius (EUS61391) was released which received an enthusiastic resonance in the national press. Further recording projects are the last three Schubert sonatas, the last three Beethoven sonatas and the complete Wohltemperirte Clavier of Bach.\n\nSince 2006 Willem Brons is member of the jury of the Sendai Competition and since 2008 of the Robert Schumann Wettbewerb in Zwickau. In 2011 a new album will be released with Bachs complete 'Wohltemperirte Clavier' book one. In 2012 he will perform Mozarts piano concerto no. 23 K. 488 with the Symphony Orchestra of Limburg.",

His first solo album was Body which was released from Sony Japan, and he followed this up with a release as part of the group known as Cancamay.\n\nChieko started her working life in the world of film and has produced numerous documentaries and dramas, as a screenplay for a drama series based on the life of a legendary Japanese violinist. Her works have collected prizes in Japan, such as with the Galaxy award, ACC award and Dentsu award.\n\nFloating World was the first self-produced Yongen album which was released from their own label, Igi, in the UK. Their second album, Moonrise was initially a Japanese release, with the \"Sunflower\" track featured in the Shiseido Ville Franche TV campaign. In 2002, they produced the debut album Relationship for Taro, which was released from Polystar Japan in 2003.\n\nThe band's name comes from the Japenese word for the fourth string, which is the warmest, strongest string on a violin. Chieko and Toshio chose the name when they realized one day how each of their lives had been shaped the violin and those who play it.",

    "description": "Harmonious thoughtful songs traverse popular forms",
    "bio": "When Zeph Allen picked up a guitar in his early teens he had no idea that music would hold him in thrall with such vague but definite power. The floating dream of being a musician and of speaking to people through song swam dreamily at the top of his conscious; an ever present unrealized ideal through his late teen and early twenties. The promise of songwriting always a couple of steps away, the focus to finish musical projects never quite found. The years passed; odd jobs, wandering, travel.\n\nAround 2005 Zeph found himself in the mountains of Floyd, Virginia having moved from his sunny, fun-filled but artistically uninspiring hometown of Key West, FL. He started a band with his cousin and a friend. They called themselves Carbon Culture. They cut a disc and a year later broke up, reformed, and added another cousin and renamed themselves Alliens. Alliens toured a few years around the region and then they too cut a disc. But times with the band were good and bad, hot and cold. The members clashed artistically and a few years in, the songwriting ground to a halt....\n\nIn the quiet days in between gigging and working construction, a grouping of songs began to take shape. They didn't follow the protocol of a single genre but nonetheless they demanded to be written and recorded. These songs are what make up Zeph's debut album Define Believe. The influences to this album range from all across the spectrum stylistically while remaining within the accepted norms of popular music. Underneath the familiar musical forms is a deeper influence. The whispering voice of a theme arisen in retrospect: A world gone mad.\n\nNow in the Bay Area of California, Zeph is writing constantly. He puzzles over the words of communication. His fragmented process steadily evolving into one of musical prosperity and production. Many songs lie in wait, some of them already written. Others exist in the ether, waiting to be plucked and placed like the magnetic words in refrigerator poems or caught in the spider's web of a struggling thoughtful mind.",

    "description": "Early Music vocal ensemble",
    "bio": "The music of Renaissance Europe comes to life in the voices of Zephyrus, the early music ensemble based in Charlottesville. Known throughout the region for its innovative programming and professional caliber, Zephyrus offers several major performances each year and appears locally in churches and at the University of Virginia.\n\nSince its founding in 1991 by director Paul Walker, Zephyrus has devoted itself to bringing the treasures of of Medieval, Renaissance, and early Baroque music to a wider audience. The ensemble's repertoire spans six centuries, from the polyphonic chants of Notre Dame Cathedral to the sacred motets of Tudor England, the madrigals of Renaissance Italy, and the masterworks of the early Baroque. The eighteen-member core group regularly divides into double chorus, quintets, and other smaller ensembles, offering a range of musical textures at every concert. Zephyrus strives for historical accuracy in performance and has enlisted the efforts of early music instrumentalists. The group has collaborated with Baroque flutist Robert Turner of Charlottesville, Medieval fiddle player Nancy Bren Nuzzo of Buffalo, NY, and theorist Scott Horton of Baltimore.\n\nIn the fall of 1997 Zephyrus presented a concert of the \"Coronation Music of James II and Queen Mary of England\" with anthems for voices and strings by Henry Purcell and John Blow. And in the spring of 1998 Zephyrus presented a pair of concerts titled \"The Dawning of Sacred Music in Germany - Exalted Music for Voices and Brass\" with sackbuts and cornetti at the Duke University Chapel in Durham, NC and at St. Paul's Memorial Church in Charlottesville. Other notable concerts have included the Taverner \"Missa Gloria Tibi Trinitas,\" presented both in Charlottesville and at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., the Victoria Requiem and Schuetz Musikalishes Exequien, and the first American performance of the Christmas Oratorio \"In Nativitatem Domini Canticum\" by Marc-Antoine Charpentier.\n\nAlso in the fall of 1997, Zephyrus released its first compact disc, Nativity, a collection of Renaissance motets for Christmas, recorded in the wonderful acoustical ambience of Holy Comforter Catholic Church in Charlottesville on the first weekend of May that year. The CD was produced by Sally Sanford, noted singer-scholar of early music, whom Dr. Walker has engaged to coach the group on several occasions in the past few years and with whom many of the members study voice on a regular basis.\n\nAs part of its educational mission, Zephyrus has presented lecture-recitals at area schools, including Piedmont Virginia Community College, the Tandem School, and Hereford College at the University of Virginia.\n\nZephyrus is led by Dr. Paul Walker, a musician and scholar who has led early music ensembles for the last sixteen years. Dr. Walker holds a Ph.D. in musicology from SUNY Buffalo and a Master's degree in organ performance from the University of Kansas. He has taught at Yale and the University of Chicago, and he now serves as director of the University of Virginia Collegium Musicum, and is on the music faculty of the University of Virginia.\n\nThe singers of Zephyrus come from a wide variety of academic and professional backgrounds, but share a love of chamber singing and a commitment to excellence in performance. Operated solely by its members, Zephyrus relies on tax-deductible contributions from area patrons to assist with its expenses.",

    "bio": "Zhaba is one musical vision of percussionist Jhos Singer (formerly Jhos Ceapach Choinn). A fascination and love of both Balkan folk music led Singer to Bulgaria in 1991 to experience it first hand. Astonishingly, the music he heard in villages and hamlets in Bulgaria invoked for him an acoustic version of the psychedelic rock he had heard at love-ins and block parties as a child in Southern California.\n\nUpon returning to the states, Singer got serious about creating the unlikely pairing of traditional Balkan folk melodies and modes with 60's psychedelic rock styling. Zhaba is the end result. The band lays down hypnotic Bulgarian and Greek rhythms, adds Balkan style vocals in languages both real and imagined, then turns the psychedelic power up to eleven.",

    "name": "Zilla",
    "description": "live, improvised electronica",
    "bio": "Zilla is a Colorado based trio of musicians with the live musical experience in mind. A 100 percent improvised creation, each Zilla concert proves to be a completely unique occurrence, with even the band members having no idea where the music will take them on any given night. Relying on their ability to listen to one another to create a hyper-focused form of live electronic dance music, Zilla is dedicated to spreading their rare breed of beats, bass, and \"uncontrollable musical fury,\" and keeps up an incredibly active live performance schedule. Their goal is that each performance reflect what live music should be all about: spontaneity, flow, groove, and a damn good dance party.\n\nZilla is comprised of three seasoned musicians: Michael Travis, Jamie Janover and Aaron Holstein.\n\nZilla's constant focus is to create a whole, complete sound devoid of fragmentation, tangential wandering solos, and other characteristics that plaque improvisational music today. The music strives to serve all those participating, including the audience. No one in the band has any idea what is going to happen a nanosecond ahead of time; they rely on their instincts and musical history together to create a sound that rarely strays from its intended direction. The collective whole is truly the dominant force in this band.\n\nThe music itself is a plethora of grooves, beats and highly percussive breaks, which cause the listener to become engulfed within the sonic vortex of sounds encompassing them. From down-tempo to jungle, from trip-hop to break-beat and trance the band plays on pure emotion, so each night is different and varied, and no song is ever the same.\n\nZilla is about being as aware as humanly possible in the moment. The band plays, the crowd reacts, the band reacts and so on and so on. A cyclical paradigm is created in which everyone plays a part. A whole new form of tension-release music has been created in which the music never has to resolve itself in order to sustain the mood. It merely adapts, evolves.\n\nIt's been said that Zilla is the ultimate live experience - future music. The music plays the band, and not the other way around. Zilla is currently touring in support of their latest CD release, Egg. Their infectious energy has crowds from North America to Japan dancing up a storm to a completely new brand of live musical experience.\n\nMusician Bios\n\nMichael Travis (drums, percussion, keyboards, sampler, mallet Kat) has spent over a decade as the driving percussive force in the nationally popular band, The String Cheese Incident. Travis continues to be an innovator of improvisational drumming, managing to play hand percussion and melodies while simultaneously keeping incredible time with the kit.\n\nAaron Holstein (bass, keyboards, sampler, vocals/vocoder/beatbox) has had a long and lush musical history, playing guitar with bands such as Boogie Shoes and VibeSquad. Holstein's progression has transformed him from the notion of a typical guitar/bass player, to an applauded adapter leaving behind the traditional notions of what it is to \"jam\" with a guitar or bass. In the process, he has focused on bass and keyboards and has decided to leave the guitar at home in order to more fully serve the Zilla concept/sound.\n\nJamie Janover (hammered dulcimer, Mini-kit, electric kalimba, mini-sitar, sampler, percussion, tamboura, tongue drum, water) is a world-renowned hammered dulcimer innovator whose long list of band credits is more than impressive. Winner of the 2002 national hammered dulcimer championships, Janover continues to expand the limits of all his instruments by creating a fusion between their timeless sounds and the pertinent call of today's modern dance scene.",
